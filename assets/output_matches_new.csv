Datasets exist in a wide variety of formats and linking them directly is often infeasible or restricted by privacy requirements. One solution is to map variables from different datasets onto a synthetic population, producing a dataset that contains information from multiple sources sufficient for reliable statistical inference with quantifiable uncertainty. This approach is universal because it is applicable to a broad range of datasets and has good potential for privacy protection.We consider datasets with information about individuals and describe three methods for building linked synthetic data: resampling, modeling predictors independently, and modeling predictors sequentially. We apply these methods to the prediction of the prevalence of Florida youth vaping by state, county, and census tract using the 2018 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey (FYSAS) and the 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS). We find that resampling and sequential modeling most closely approximate the 2018 survey results, and that the sequential model captures more variability. We find that the order of predicting the variables in sequential modeling does not substantially impact the outcome.",2021,2021-05-06,0,Georgiy Bobashev; Emily Hadley; Alan F.

Population-based studies show differential rates of ADHD and ASD diagnosis based on sociodemographic variables. However, no studies to date have examined the role of sociodemographic factors on the likelihood of receiving an ADHD, ASD, or comorbid ASD+ADHD diagnosis in a large, nationally representative sample. This study aims to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on the odds of experiencing ASD-only, ADHD-only, or both diagnoses for children in the United States. Using a mixed effects multinomial logistic modeling approach and data from the 2016-2018 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated the association between sociodemographic variables and the log odds of being in each diagnostic group. Sociodemographic variables were differentially related to the three diagnostic groups: ASD-only, ADHD-only, and ASD+ADHD. Compared to girls, boys experienced higher odds of all three diagnosis categories. White children had higher odds of having an ADHD-only or ASD+ADHD diagnosis compared to Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, NH multiple/other race, and Hispanic children. Odds ratios for levels of parent education, household income, and birth characteristics showed varying trends across diagnostic groups. Overall, our findings point to unique sets of risk factors differentially associated ASD and ADHD, with lower income standing out as an important factor associated with receiving a diagnosis of ASD+ADHD.",2023,2023-08-02,10,Alexis Federico; Anja Zgodic; Kate Flory; Rachel M.

Recent work has quantified the prevalence of PCEs at the national level, but these studies have been based on public use data files, which lack rurality information for 19 states. Methods Data for this cross‐sectional analysis were drawn from 2016 to 2018 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), using the full data set with restricted geographic data (n = 63,000). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to calculate proportions and unadjusted associations. Multivariable regression models were used to examine the association between residence and the PCEs that were significant in the bivariate analyses. Findings Rural children were more likely than urban children to be reported as having PCEs: volunteering in their community (aOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.18‐1.42), having a guiding mentor (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.45‐2.10), residing in a safe neighborhood (aOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.54‐2.53), and residing in a supportive neighborhood (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01‐1.20) than urban children. Conclusions The assessment of rural‐urban differences in PCEs using the full NSCH is a unique opportunity to quantify exposure to PCEs. Given the higher baseline rate of PCEs in rural than urban children, programs to increase opportunities for PCEs in urban communities are warranted. Future research should delve further into whether these PCEs translate to better mental health outcomes in rural children.",2022,2022-08-27,8,Elizabeth Crouch; Janice C.

However, there are few data that show how the incidence and duration of periods in which persons do not have insurance have changed over time.We used two data sets from the Survey of Income and Program Participation of the U.S. Census Bureau: one that covered the period from 1983 through 1986 (25,946 persons), and another that covered the period from 2001 through 2004 (40,282 persons). For each set of years, we estimated the probability that a person would be uninsured for some period of time and the probability that a person would subsequently obtain private or public insurance. We also estimated the probabilities that persons in various demographic groups would become uninsured over the course of a year and would remain uninsured for various amounts of time.The percentage of the population that lost insurance in a 12-month period increased from 19.8% in 1983-1986 to 21.8% in 2001-2004 (P=0.04). The percentage that was uninsured for a period of time increased markedly among persons with the lowest educational level and predominantly represented loss of private coverage. The percentage of new uninsured periods that ended within 24 months increased from 73.8% to 79.7% between the two study periods (P<0.001); increases were seen in all age groups and among persons of all educational levels. Transition from no insurance to private insurance decreased from 65.2% to 59.2% (P<0.001). Transition from no insurance to public insurance increased from 8.7% to 20.4% (P<0.001).As compared with the years from 1983 through 1986, from 2001 through 2004, more people, particularly those with the lowest educational level, had periods in which they were not insured. The periods without insurance were shorter in 2001-2004 than they were in 1983-1986, since an increase in transitions to public coverage offset a reduction in transitions to private coverage. Our results portend difficulties if private coverage continues to decline and is not offset by further expansions of public insurance.",2009,2009-04-22,37,David Cutler; Alexander Gelber,Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Primary Care and Health Outcomes,New England Journal of Medicine,04,"Cutler, David; Gelber, Alexander. 2009.

Currently the U.S. Census Bureau imputes employer contributions in the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey based on data from the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey.

Firm level concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), varies across the sectors comprising the industry, but all are within the range generally considered as indicative of a competitive industry. The data available allowed HHI to be calculated for the period 1977–2002 in the case of advertising agencies and for 1997 and 2002 for the other industry sectors. At the holding company level, the four largest organizations account for only about a quarter of the industry's total revenue, a share that changed little over the period 2002–2008, but one that is approximately half of estimates frequently cited in the trade press.

Lessons from Maine's 2017 Referendum,"Abstract Context: In November 2017, Maine became the first state in the nation to vote on a key provision of the Affordable Care Act: the expansion of Medicaid. Methods: This study merged official election results from localities across Maine with Census Bureau and American Hospital Association data to identify characteristics of areas that support Medicaid expansion. Findings: Places with more bachelor's degree holders more often vote in favor, whereas those with more associate's degree graduates tend to vote against. Conditional on education rates, areas with more uninsured individuals who would qualify for expanded coverage tend to vote in favor, while those with more high-income individuals tend to vote against. Also conditional on education rates, greater hospital employment is associated with support for expansion, but the presence of other health professionals, whose incomes might decrease from expansion, is associated with less support. Conclusions: Voting patterns are mostly consistent with economic self-interest, except for the sizable association of bachelor's degree holders with support for Medicaid expansion. Direct democracy can shift Medicaid policy: extrapolating to other states, the model predicts that hypothetical referenda would pass in 5 of the 18 states that had not yet expanded Medicaid at the time of Maine's vote.",2019,2019-04-12,5,David A.

The U.S. Census Bureau releases Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) ACS files to allow public entities the ability to examine detailed individual-level data. In order to protect the confidentiality of survey participants, the Census only allows individual-level observations to be geographically referenced with Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)—polygons that contain at least 100,000 people. Microdata files offer the unique advantage of creating custom tabulations on the population that are not made available elsewhere. The advantages from using PUMS files are limited by the typology of PUMAs. Our project fills a gap by introducing the reader to how PUMA typology is produced and how it affects research. The specific aim of this project is to highlight the fact that PUMAs can be fragmented—made up of physically non-adjacent/multi-part polygons. This is important because the treatment of fragmented/multi-part polygons as contiguous spatial entities erroneously imposes a false structure of contiguity that challenges theoretical and statistical assumptions in geographically aware research. By providing evidence from three metropolitan areas in Texas (USA) and displaying the degree of polygon discontiguity concentration by state, we outline some of the implications of polygon discontiguity for research and policy. We compliment our descriptive investigation by discussing solutions in closing and by identifying and discussing the three general elements in polygon fragmentation: quantity, distance, and size.",2013,2013-04-01,18,Carlos Siordia; A J Fox,The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston; Texas A&M University,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",Spatial Demography,04,"Siordia, Carlos; Fox, A J. 2013.

We show that this appears to be the case for the existing imputations in the Census of Manufactures. We then present an alternative strategy for handling the missing data based on multiple imputation. Specifically, we impute missing values via sequences of classification and regression trees, which offer a computationally straightforward and flexible approach for semi-automatic, large-scale multiple imputation. We also present an approach to evaluating these imputations based on posterior predictive checks. We use the multiple imputations, and the imputations currently employed by the Census Bureau, to estimate production function parameters and productivity dispersions.

First, we turn to the raw self-reported data for the US, reflecting what can be found in most developing countries. In the raw data, measured misallocation (following Hsieh and Klenow 2009) is substantially higher than for any other country for which we have census data. For instance, if Indian firms had the same dispersion of distortions as measured in the reported US data, TFP in the Indian manufacturing sector would decrease by around 2/3. Second, we follow a different strategy for editing and imputing missing data than what is used by the US Census Bureau, by using a method that seeks to replicate the true variance in the underlying data generating process known as Classification and Regression Trees (CART). This change raises the potential gains from removing misallocation in the United States manufacturing sector by around 10%.",2016,2016-01-01,18,Mitsukuni Nishida; Amil Petrin; Martin Rotemberg; T.

For five variables entering TFP, we show that dispersion is significantly smaller in the Census mean-imputed versus the nonimputed data.

For 90% of the 473 industries in 2002 and 84% of the 471 industries in 2007, we find that TFP dispersion increases as we move from Census mean-imputed data to nonimputed data to the CART-imputed data.",2017,2017-06-18,35,T.

Among these are integrating crossnational themes of government efficiency, evidencebased policy, and open data. The use of public sector administrative data for census-taking is a natural use of a National Data Infrastructure, taking advantage of “joined-up data”. MacFeely and Dunne’s paper provides clear examples of the challenges of establishing such data, yet describes a path forward to realize needed efficiencies for Ireland. My comments and reactions relate to the paper as well as John Dunne’s presentation at the International Conference on Census Methods last summer. My colleagues at the U.S. Census Bureau sponsored the event to learn best practices from our international counterparts. We heard of common struggles and great ideas for moving forward, including the Irish initiative discussed in the MacFeely-Dunne paper. But first a bit about the U.S. Statistical System: The U.S. Federal Statistical System is comprised of 13 principal statistical agencies and over 100 statistical programs within Executive Branch agencies. The U.S. does not have a national statistics act. Separate legislative authorities set the domain and scope for each entity within the system. This has important implications for the utility of federal statistical information for Decennial Censuses or policymaking. The U.S. Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency in the U.S. Federal System and the leading source of quality data about the United States people and economy. Like Ireland and other countries, the Census Bureau is exploring uses of administrative records to reduce costs, reduce respondent burden, improve data quality, and produce new data products. The Census Bureau links data for statistical uses, not for enforcement or surveillance use. Statistical use means that information will not be used to make decisions concerning the rights, benefits, or privileges of specific individuals. As discussed at the conference, the U.S. is testing the statistical use of administrative records for the 2020 Census. These efforts build on decades of work describing and encouraging the efficient re-use of government records (e.g. [1,2]). The Census Bureau has heeded advice from the National Research Council [3] and invested in the infrastructure to acquire and link administrative data. The Census Bureau has conducted research to assess coverage and accuracy [5]. We are finding enormous opportunities for address registry and population measurement, analogous to what has happened in may countries in Europe. As the authors explain, integrated (Joined up) data are powerful. In the U.S., government agencies are working together to link data for program evaluation and policy analysis. However, the NDI in Ireland would also be used to achieve administrative efficiency by using person-level data for administrative/official interventions. These non-statistical uses are beyond the scope of work underway at the Census Bureau, Legislative change would be required to have joined-up data for government operations in the U.S. There is an effort to increase the use of administrative records government-wide in the U.S. [4].

Income data are available from surveys, tax records, and government programs, but each of these sources has important strengths and major limitations when used alone. We are linking multiple data sources to develop the Comprehensive Income Dataset (CID), a restricted micro-level dataset that combines the demographic detail of survey data with the accuracy of administrative measures. By incorporating information on nearly all taxable income, tax credits, and cash and in-kind government transfers, the CID surpasses previous efforts to provide an accurate and comprehensive measure of income for the population of U.S. individuals, families, and households. We use models to evaluate differences across the data sources and explore imputation methods and trends over time. The CID can enhance Census Bureau surveys and statistics through investigating measurement error, improving imputation methods, and augmenting surveys with the best possible estimates of income. It can also be used to improve the administration of taxes by the Internal Revenue Service and forecast and simulate changes in programs and taxes. Finally, the CID has substantial advantages over other sources to analyze numerous research topics, including poverty, inequality, mobility, and the distributional consequences of government transfers and taxes.",2018,2018-10-11,3,Carla Medalia; Bruce Meyer; Amy O’Hara; Derek Wu,United States Census Bureau; American Enterprise Institute; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Georgetown University; Statistical Research (United States); University of Chicago,"Income, Poverty, and Inequality; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",International Journal for Population Data Science,10,"Medalia, Carla; Meyer, Bruce; O’Hara, Amy; Wu, Derek. 2018.

Primary barriers to intra-agency data sharing include both perceived legal barriers and actual financial barriers. To address these problems, the potential path forward could include mandating data sharing for key sources, increasing transparency, and improving efficiency by making it easier for agencies to share data (including developing standards, templates, and incentives). We argue that an agency within the federal statistical system should serve as an intermediary for data integration across the federal statistical system and that the U.S. Census Bureau, with its experience and uniquely broad authority to seek data from any public or private entity for statistical purposes, is well positioned to fill this role.",2017,2017-12-21,1,Amy O’Hara; Carla Medalia,,Data Quality and Management; Census and Population Estimation; Data Analysis and Archiving,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,12,"O’Hara, Amy; Medalia, Carla. 2017.

Because of this, data publishers are realizing that traditional statistical disclosure limitation methods may not protect privacy.&#x0D; This paper discusses the use of differential privacy at the US Census Bureau to protect the published results of the 2020 census. We first discuss the legal framework under which the Census Bureau intends to use differential privacy. The Census Act in the US states that the agency must keep information confidential, avoiding “any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual under this title can be identified.” The fact that Census may release fewer statistics in 2020 than in 2010 is leading scholars to parse the meaning of identification and reevaluate the agency’s responsibility to balance data utility with privacy protection.&#x0D; We then describe technical aspects of the application of differential privacy in the U.S. Census. This data collection is enormously complex and serves a wide variety of users and uses -- 7.8 billion statistics were released using the 2010 US Census. This complexity strains the application of differential privacy to ensure appropriate geographic relationships, respect legal requirements for certain statistics to be free of noise infusion, and provide information for detailed demographic groups.&#x0D; We end by discussing the prospects of applying formal mathematical privacy to other information products at the Census Bureau. At present, techniques exist for applying differential privacy to descriptive statistics, histograms, and counts, but are less developed for more complex data releases including panel data, linked data, and vast person-level datasets. We expect the continued development of formally private methods to occur alongside discussions of what privacy means and the policy issues involved in trading off protection for accuracy.",2019,2019-11-25,0,Amy O’Hara; Quentin Brummet,Georgetown University,Census and Population Estimation; Privacy-Preserving Technologies in Data,International Journal for Population Data Science,11,"O’Hara, Amy; Brummet, Quentin. 2019.

Among respondents who first established an independent household during the 1970s, improvement in neighborhood income over the adult life course was substantially greater for white than for black respondents; the racial difference in the percentage of neighbors who were non-Hispanic white narrowed slightly with age. Racial differences in the characteristics of neighborhoods inhabited during adolescence help explain racial differences in starting points and, to a lesser extent, subsequent trajectories of neighborhood attainment.

Housing indices that capture the multiple dimensions of healthy housing are important for tracking conditions and identifying vulnerable households. However, most indices focus on physical deficiencies and repair costs and omit indoor environmental exposures, as few national data sources routinely collect this information. Methods We developed a multidimensional Housing and Environmental Quality Index (HEQI) based on the World Health Organization’s Housing and Health Guidelines and applied it to the 2019 American Housing Survey (AHS). The HEQI consisted of ten domains associated with poor health: household fuel combustion, dampness and mold, pests and allergens, lead paint risk, high indoor temperatures, low indoor temperatures, household crowding, injury hazards, inadequate water and sanitation, and ventilation. We evaluated the validity and performance of the HEQI against three housing characteristics (i.e., year built, monthly rent costs, unit satisfaction rating) and two established indices (i.e., Adequacy Index, Poor Quality Index). Results Approximately 79% (92 million) of U.S. households reported at least one HEQI domain associated with poor health (mean per household: 1.3; range: 0,8). Prevalent domains included household fuel combustion (61.4%), dampness and mold (15.9%), inadequate water and sanitation (14.3%), and injury hazards (11.9%).

Although research on teamwork has typically focused on its impact on work products, we complement that work by examining the degree to which teamwork influences salary, hours worked, and overall job satisfaction. Drawing on microdata collected through the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as well as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we find that doctoral degree holders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields tend to earn substantially higher salaries and work more hours when they engage in teamwork. We also find no comparable difference in overall job satisfaction as a function of whether individuals work within teams. Additionally, we find evidence that age interacts significantly with teamwork, whereby older teamworkers tend to earn relatively more when participating in teams without appearing to work more hours; and we show that employment sector is important, whereby teamwork is relevant for salaries and hours worked in education and industry but not in government. Although our study is based on market outcomes and behavioral measures, our findings provide grounds for future research that examines the psychological mechanisms that are relevant to understanding why people join teams as well as the psychological consequences that people encounter through teamwork. More generally, this study provides a model for considering individual-level antecedents and outcomes associated with teamwork when degrees of discretion exist with respect to teaming.

By drawing upon responses to the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we track changes in the backgrounds of doctoral graduates and find a trend over the past 20 years towards more gender, ethnic, and citizenship diversity. We also find that PhD cohorts in Business opt for Industry employment at approximately the same rate as non-Business PhD cohorts while very few pursue “postdoc” employment. We show substantial differences whereby Business salaries tend to be diverging towards nearly twice the income paid to non-Business doctoral graduates and – among the Business subfields – we find a wide range with Accounting earning the highest wages and Human Resources being paid the lowest. Our findings suggest that Business School faculty are not paid relatively high wages due to private-sector competition as is conventionally assumed; instead, it seems plausible that the salary differential exists partly to compensate for the typically higher wages earned by the non-PhD graduates that business schools train. Alternate explanations include the possibility that there current Business School faculty salaries are the unsustainable result of runaway competition among schools.

In particular, the analyses explore the impact of survey methods on responses to the work limitation (i.e., employment disability) question in these two Census products. Building on the research of Stern (2003) and Stern and Brault (2005), we look for further evidence of misreporting of an employment disability by specific sub-populations using the participation in the Supplemental Security Income program as an exogenous employment disability status indicator along with a subset of ACS disability questions. We expand upon these earlier studies by examining both false-positive and false-negative reports of employment disability by implementing logit estimations to examine the role of respondent/enumerator error on the accuracy of the employment disability response. In this manner, we enhance our understanding of Census 2000 and ACS responses to employment disability questions through an exploration of the role of enumeration procedures in two types of misclassifications, as well as by evaluating existing data and estimates to uncover characteristics that might make an individual more likely to misreport an employment disability.",2009,2009-01-01,3,Andrew J.

Furthermore, the authors show that using the sample of the working-age population with disabilities identified by the six-question sequence will lead to biased estimates of key social policy success parameters; in particular, it will overestimate their employment rates and underestimate the share that are receiving Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income-Disabled Adults benefits relative to the broader sample that includes a work-limitation question and the six-question sequence.",2012,2012-06-05,74,Richard V.

Mandated by federal statute, six dichotomous difficulty-focused questions were implemented in national surveys to identify people with disabilities. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, demographic characteristics and social factors among people with disabilities based on these six questions using multiple national surveys in the USA. Setting American Community Survey (ACS), Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Participants Civilian, non-institutionalised US residents aged 18 and over from the 2009 to 2014 ACS, 2009 to 2014 CPS-ASEC, 2009 to 2014 NHIS and 2008 SIPP waves 3, 7 and 10. Primary and secondary outcome measures Disability was assessed using six standardised questions asking people about hearing, vision, cognition, ambulatory, self-care and independent living disabilities. Social factors were assessed with questions asking people to report their education, employment status, family size, health and marital status, health insurance and income. Results Risk ratios and demographic distributions for people with disabilities were consistent across survey. People with disabilities were at decreased risk of having college education, employment, families with three or more people, excellent or very good self-reported health and a spouse. People with disabilities were also consistently at greater risk of having health insurance and living below the poverty line. Estimates of disability prevalence varied between surveys from 2009 to 2014 (range 11.76%–17.08%). Conclusion Replicating the existing literature, we found the estimation of disparities and inequity people with disabilities experience to be consistent across survey. Although there was a range of prevalence estimates, demographic factors for people with disabilities were consistent across surveys.

However, people with disabilities are a hard-to-reach population. Internet survey methods offer tremendous potential to expand researchers’ ability to reach and learn about people with disabilities. The goal of this study is to examine potential bias when using nonprobability Internet samples to investigate demographics and socioeconomic outcomes of people with disabilities. We compare the findings based on a national employment and disability survey instrument fielded to four samples: (1) a random-digit dial (RDD) sample, (2) a prescreened sample from a nonprobability Internet access panel, for which screening was based on the presence of 139 previously reported health conditions, (3) an unscreened sample from another nonprobability Internet access panel (without previously prescreened health conditions), and (4) a mixed nonprobability self-recruited (river and snowball) sample. Each sample was weighted on four demographic variables (gender, age, race/ethnicity, and region) using benchmarks from the American Community Survey (ACS). Three dichotomous outcome variables of interest (level of education, household income, and current employment status) were contrasted with weighted population estimates from the ACS. Results showed that the sample resulting from the RDD and all three nonprobability Internet samples differed significantly from ACS population estimates on all three outcome variables. Reweighting to include type of functional disability did not significantly reduce dissimilarities with ACS for any of the four samples. Nonprobability Internet survey methods offer relatively low-cost, easy-to-use avenues for disability-related research.

The BIP is one of the largest USDA broadband programmes implemented to date, providing more than $3.4 billion in grants and loans in FY 2010. We investigate the impacts of BIP investments on employment outcomes in BIP-recipient Census tracts compared to similar tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. We use a quasi-experimental research design that combines difference-in-difference regression with propensity score matching estimation to identify the causal effect of the BIP investments on employment outcomes. We find that the BIP investments had a positive overall effect on employment growth that increased over time. The subsidized investments had a greater effect on employment in startups than in incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and the information and communications technology sector than other sectors, and a greater effect in micropolitan census tracts than tracts located in metropolitan areas or in small town and remote rural locations. Este artículo estudia los efectos en el mercado laboral del Programa de Iniciativas de Banda Ancha (BIP, por sus siglas en inglés), un programa autorizado por la Ley de Recuperación y Reinversión de Estados Unidos de 2009 para promover el despliegue de la banda ancha, principalmente en zonas rurales. El BIP es uno de los mayores programas de banda ancha del USDA ejecutados hasta la fecha, y en el 2010 concedió más de 3.400 millones de dólares en subvenciones y préstamos. Se investigaron los impactos de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo en los tramos censales receptores de BIP en comparación con tramos similares fuera de las áreas cubiertas por el proyecto BIP entre el inicio del programa en 2010 y 2019. Se utilizó un diseño de investigación cuasi-experimental que combina la regresión de diferencias en diferencias con una estimación basada en pareamiento por puntaje de propensión para identificar el efecto causal de las inversiones del BIP en los resultados de empleo. Las inversiones del BIP tuvieron un efecto global positivo en el crecimiento del empleo, que aumentó con el tiempo. Las inversiones subvencionadas tuvieron un mayor efecto sobre el empleo en las empresas de nueva creación que en las ya existentes, en el sector de la producción de bienes y en el sector de las tecnologías de la información y las comunicaciones que en otros sectores, y un mayor efecto en los tramos censales micropolitanos que en los situados en áreas metropolitanas o en localidades rurales pequeñas y remotas. 本稿では、2009年アメリカ復興・再投資法によって認可された、主に農村地域におけるブロードバンドの導入を促進するためのプログラムであるブロードバンド・イニシアティブ・プログラム(Broadband Initiatives Program:BIP)の労働市場への影響を検討する。BIPは、2010年度には34億ドル以上の補助金と融資を提供しており、これまでに実施された米国農務省のブロードバンド・プログラムの中でも最大規模である。プログラムが開始された2010年から2019年までの、国勢統計区におけるBIP受給者の雇用成果に対するBIP投資の影響を、BIPプロジェクトのサービス対象地域以外の同様の地域と比較して調査した。差分の差分法と傾向スコアマッチング推定を組み合わせた疑似実験デザインを用いて、BIP投資が雇用成果に及ぼす因果効果の解明を試みた。BIP投資は全体的に雇用増加に全体的なプラスの効果をもたらし、さらにその効果は時間の経過とともに増大した。補助金による投資は、既存の企業の雇用よりもスタートアップの雇用に大きな影響を与え、他の部門よりも財生産部門や情報通信技術部門に大きな影響を与え、小都市の国勢統計区では大都市圏や小さな町あるいは僻地の国勢統計区よりも大きな影響を与えていた。 The deployment of high-speed broadband in underserved rural areas has become an important rural development policy over the last two decades. Benefits of access to broadband in rural areas are manifold, including business development through reduced input costs and e-commerce, job growth through business creation and expansion, access to healthcare and telemedicine, and other benefits (Abrardi & Cambini, 2019; Atasoy, 2013; Benda et al., 2020; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Stenberg et al., 2009). However, broadband deployment in rural underserved areas is expensive due to remoteness and sparse population in these places, requiring very large up-front capital expenditures by service providers (Kandilov & Renkow, 2010). As a result, 17% of rural Americans did not have access to fixed terrestrial broadband service anywhere in their census block in December 2019 (Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2021), while 41% of rural households did not have wired high-speed Internet service in their homes in November 2021 (National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), 2022). Federal investments in the United States promoting access to broadband in rural communities have been increasing over the last two decades. During fiscal years 2015 to 2020, the Federal Government spent more than $50 billion to promote broadband deployment and use through 12 programmes, focused mainly on rural areas, and Congress has appropriated nearly $75 billion for 13 new broadband programmes established since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2022). The general objective of many of these programmes is to provide broadband infrastructure in unserved and underserved areas, which is expected to stimulate improvements in social and economic well-being in these areas. This paper explores the impacts of one of these federal investments—the USDA Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP)—on employment growth. Several USDA programmes have supported broadband development in rural areas in the United States for the past two decades. The BIP is one of the largest of these programmes, created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated a total of $2.5 billion to USDA's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment, mainly in rural areas of the country. Despite the large size of the BIP and length of time since the programme was completed, few published studies have investigated impacts of this programme, except two recent papers by Bai et al. (2022) and Pender et al. (2022). 1 This paper contributes to this small literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which was not addressed in either of those studies. The impacts of provision of broadband infrastructure on employment growth and other socio-economic outcomes depend on whether such infrastructure results in increased adoption and use of broadband, or use of broadband at higher speeds than previously, by businesses, households, and other end users. 2 Unfortunately, data on adoption and use of broadband by businesses are not generally available. Existing empirical evidence on effects of broadband availability on broadband adoption by households supports the notion that increased availability leads to more adoption, especially in rural areas (Pender et al., 2022; Silva et al., 2018; Whitacre et al., 2013). In addition to finding that initial broadband availability contributes to subsequent household broadband adoption, Pender et al. (2022) found that BIP increased the average share of households adopting broadband by about 1.1–3.0 percentage points by 2016. Beyond the effect of BIP on broadband adoption, there is the question of how the programme affected socio-economic outcomes such as employment growth. The socio-economic benefits of increasing access to broadband in rural communities are widely documented as described in the literature review below. However, no published studies have investigated impacts of the BIP on employment growth and few studies have investigated employment impacts of any Federal broadband programme. In this study, we investigate the impacts of the BIP on employment growth in BIP-recipient census tracts compared to similar census tracts outside of BIP project service areas between the inception of the programme in 2010 and 2019. The expectation from a policy perspective was that the BIP would lead to increased access to broadband in unserved and underserved areas, promoting economic growth by saving existing jobs and creating more. However, theoretically, the employment impacts of such investment incentives are ambiguous. Although broadband investments may increase job opportunities due to the direct employment and multiplier effects of broadband deployment and maintenance, promotion of new business formation, retention and expansion of existing businesses, attraction of workers, reduction in search costs in labour markets, and other factors, they may also reduce employment in some regions or for some types of workers due to increased competition or substitution of local labour by capital expenditures or outsourcing of work to other firms and locations (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013; Duvivier, 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019; Kolko, 2012; Kuttner, 2016; Stephens et al., 2022). In addition to investigating the impact of BIP on overall employment changes, we examine whether employment effects are heterogeneous between incumbent establishments and startups, across broad industry sectors, and across the urban/rural spectrum. Although the BIP was intended to be mainly focused on rural areas, it was not strictly limited to such areas, and the programme service areas included areas located within metropolitan and micropolitan areas. 3 Earlier research has found that broadband provision has resulted in positive net establishment entry in the United States (Chen et al., 2023), which is the largest source of employment growth impacts of broadband provision, though broadband also has contributed to employment growth in incumbent businesses (Kolko, 2012). The literature has also shown that employment impacts of broadband provision vary across industry sectors (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Shideler et al., 2007) and between urban and rural markets (Atasoy, 2013; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Thus, we expect that the impacts of BIP may differ between incumbent businesses and startups and across industry sectors and geographic contexts. Our analysis uses a reduced form approach, investigating the effects of BIP on employment outcomes without investigating the mediating mechanisms by which such outcomes may have occurred due to data limitations—such as the lack of publicly available data on broadband adoption by businesses. It assumes that broadband deployment through BIP investments translates into adoption by consumers and businesses, influencing employment outcomes in programme recipient areas. We find that BIP investments had a positive effect on employment growth overall, with the impacts generally increasing over time. BIP had a greater effect on employment in startups than incumbent businesses, in the goods-producing sector and information and communication technology (ICT) subsector than in other sectors, and in micropolitan census tracts than in metropolitan and remote rural locations. Broadband can affect regional employment through many mechanisms. Broadband deployment can increase the demand for labour since labour is required to manufacture, deploy, and maintain the necessary infrastructure and parts (Atasoy, 2013), some of which may be provided by workers within a given region. Such direct employment effects may have indirect and induced multiplier effects on local labour demand (Kuttner, 2016). Broadband can affect demand for the goods and services produced in a region by increasing access of local firms to more distant markets and competition with more distant firms (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband may affect the productivity of firms, which can have mixed effects on labour demand depending on the substitution or complementarity relationships between the technologies that broadband enables and different types/skill levels of labour (Akerman et al., 2015; Atasoy, 2013). By increasing access to information and the productivity of firms, broadband availability may attract firms (especially those in knowledge-intensive industries) to startup or relocate to a region with better broadband service and a sufficiently skilled workforce (Atasoy, 2013; Chen et al., 2023; Conroy & Low, 2022; Deller et al., 2022; Duvivier, 2019; Kim & Orazem, 2017; Kolko, 2012; Mack, 2014, 2015; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack et al., 2011; Mack, 2014; Mack & Rey, 2014; Mack & Wentz, 2017; Shideler & Badasyan, 2012; Stephens et al., 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Broadband access may help existing firms survive and grow (Kolko, 2012), though it may also undermine survival of local businesses by increasing competition with distant providers of goods and services (Stephens et al., 2022). All these mechanisms can affect the demand for labour in a region (Kolko, 2012). Broadband can also affect the supply of labour in a region. As a consumer amenity providing improved access to goods and services that affect quality of life, broadband can affect migration (Mahasuweerachai et al., 2010) and home buying decisions (Deller & Whitacre, 2019; Molnar et al., 2019) and thus the supply of labour in a region. Broadband access enables telework (Carvalho et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022), which may attract people to live and telework in places that were previously too distant to commute from. Broadband also can reduce search costs in the labour market for job applicants and employers, helping to reduce unemployment and vacancies (Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019) and improve the worker-firm matching process (Atasoy, 2013). Broadband access (especially mobile broadband) may also facilitate peer-to-peer markets for employment opportunities (""gig jobs"") such as Uber/Lyft drivers and domestic services (Abraham et al., 2019; Goldfarb & Tucker, 2019). A large and growing literature on broadband finds positive effects of high-speed internet on economic outcomes at a local level (usually the county or zip code level) in the United States, particularly labour market outcomes. Numerous studies have found a positive association of broadband availability with employment and/or a negative association with unemployment (Atasoy, 2013; Bai, 2017; Guidry et al., 2012; Isley & Low, 2022; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Kolko, 2012; Lobo et al., 2020; Shideler et al., 2007; Stenberg et al., 2009; Whitacre et al., 2014b). Not all studies have found positive effects of broadband availability on employment, however. Several found statistically insignificant effects, particularly when examining impacts of broadband deployment on changes in employment over time (Ford, 2018; Jayakar & Park, 2013; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2018). The impacts of broadband availability on employment have been found in several studies to be context dependent. For example, Kolko (2012) found that the employment impacts of broadband provision were greater in less densely populated Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Similarly, Atasoy (2013) found that the positive effect of broadband availability on employment rate was greater in more rural areas, especially those with more skilled workers. By contrast, Whitacre et al. (2014b) found, using cross-sectional spatial error model (SEM) regressions, that high broadband availability was positively associated with greater total employment in metro counties but not in nonmetro counties, while they found no statistically significant effect of changes in broadband availability on employment change in either metro or nonmetro counties using first difference ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. In a study of impacts of broadband availability on county-level unemployment rates in Tennessee, Lobo et al. (2020) found a significant negative association of high-speed broadband with unemployment rates, but only in rural counties. Thus several, but not all, studies that investigated the effects of rurality found greater impacts of improvements in broadband availability on employment in more rural areas. Several studies have found a positive association of broadband adoption with employment or a negative association with unemployment (Carvalho et al., 2022; Isley & Low, 2022; Whitacre et al., 2014a, 2014b). Although Whitacre et al. (2014b) found a positive association between high broadband adoption and total employment in nonmetro counties in their cross-sectional SEM regressions, they found no statistically significant impact of broadband adoption on employment in their first difference OLS regressions, so this result for impacts of broadband adoption was not robust to the method used. Carvalho et al. (2022) investigated the effects of broadband adoption combined with the ability of workers to telework, on county unemployment rates in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, finding that counties in the southeastern United States with greater initial adoption of broadband and a greater share of the workforce able to telework had less growth in unemployment. One study by Forman et al. (2012) investigated the impacts of commercial businesses' use of advanced Internet applications—which depend on broadband availability and adoption by businesses—on county employment growth in the late 1990s. That study found a weakly statistically significant (at 10% level) positive effect of use of advanced Internet applications on county employment growth, with this effect concentrated in counties with high levels of household income, education, information technology intensity, and population. Fewer studies have investigated impacts of programmes designed to increase broadband availability or adoption on employment outcomes. Several studies have investigated impacts of the USDA Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program (RBLP) and its predecessor, the pilot Broadband Loan Program (BBLP) (Dinterman & Renkow, 2017; Kandilov & Renkow, 2010, 2020; Kandilov et al., 2017; U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 2014). Of these studies, only Kandilov and Renkow (2010) and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) investigated impacts of these programmes on employment. 4 Kandilov and Renkow (2010) investigated impacts of the pilot BBLP and RBLP at both zip code and county level, focusing on zip code areas or counties that had a population of 20,000 or less in the year 2000. They found a positive impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in their baseline regression at the zip code level and a small and statistically insignificant impact of the RBLP on employment. They argued that the more limited effects of the RBLP could have been due to the limited amount of time between when loans began to be administered under that programme in 2004 and the end of their study period in 2007. They found that the pilot BBLP had a positive association with employment only in metro counties, while in nonmetro counties not adjacent to a metro area, both the pilot BBLP and the RBLP had a negative association with employment. They found no statistically significant impact of either programme on total employment in county-level regressions. Across industries, they found a negative impact of the pilot BBLP on employment in information services, negative impacts of the RBLP on employment in utilities and retail trade, and a positive impact of the RBLP on employment in the real estate and rental industry. They argued that the negative effects of these broadband programmes on employment in some sectors could be due to competition for local businesses facilitated by broadband access. In general, Kandilov and Renkow's results demonstrate that a broadband programme can have heterogeneous effects on employment in different geographic contexts and industries, and likely also depend on how much time has elapsed since the inception of the programme. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) also investigated impacts of the RBLP on employment, using county-level regressions and focusing on a longer period than Kandilov and Renkow (2010) (2003–2011). Unlike Kandilov and Renkow, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found robust positive impacts of the RBLP on employment across several analyses with alternative control groups, using its baseline sample of counties with at least 90% of the county population residing in a rural area or an urban cluster of less than 50,000 people. Using instead a more restrictive definition of rural counties—excluding people in urban clusters—U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) (2014) found statistically insignificant impacts of the RBLP on employment. The lack of significant impacts with the more rural sample of counties reflects a much smaller sample of counties classified as ""rural"" having received RBLP loans, resulting in larger standard errors of the estimated impacts, and does not necessarily reflect actual heterogeneity of impacts between more and less rural counties. Two peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)—the sister programme to the BIP also funded by ARRA—on broadband adoption (Chang, 2021; Hauge & Prieger, 2015). Both these studies found statistically insignificant impacts of BTOP grants on broadband adoption. Two recent peer-reviewed studies have investigated impacts of BIP (Bai et al., 2022; Pender et al., 2022). Bai et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on farm productivity (defined as farm sales per farm employment), finding a significant positive but short-term impact on farm productivity. Pender et al. (2022) investigated the impact of BIP on broadband adoption and telework, finding positive impacts on both outcomes. No published peer-reviewed study that we are aware of has investigated impacts of either BTOP or BIP on employment outcomes. The available literature suggests that a programme such as BIP, which financed deployment of broadband infrastructure in mostly (but not only) rural areas, could have affected employment in recipient areas through multiple mechanisms, with possibly different impacts on employment in business startups than on employment in incumbent businesses. The literature also suggests the impacts may have been heterogeneous across geographic contexts and industries. The present study contributes to the literature by investigating the impacts of BIP on employment, which has not been reported in any published studies. We investigate the heterogeneity of BIP impacts on employment across several dimensions, including geography, industry, and whether employment change occurred in startup or incumbent business at the time BIP was initiated. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) was authorized as a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, which appropriated $2.5 billion to U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) to promote broadband deployment in rural areas of the country. ARRA also expanded the existing authority of RUS to make loans and provided new authority to make grants for the purpose of facilitating broadband deployment in rural communities. RUS leveraged the budget authority provided by ARRA to make grants, loans and loan/grant combination awards. In total, over $2.23 billion in grants and $1.19 billion in loans were made to 299 terrestrial broadband infrastructure projects throughout the country. 5 All BIP awards were made in two rounds in FY 2010. ARRA required the project service areas to be at least 75% rural (in terms of area) and without broadband availability at 5 megabits per second (mbps) (upstream plus downstream) in at least 50% of each project service area. Rural areas were defined as: ""Any area, as confirmed by the latest decennial census of the Bureau of the Census, which is not located within: (1) a city, town, or incorporated area that has a population of greater than 20,000 inhabitants; or (2) an urbanized area contiguous and adjacent to a city or town that has a population of greater than 50,000 inhabitants."" Based on these criteria, project service areas are mostly at the subcounty level, and some of the qualified rural areas are located within metro counties. Infrastructure projects supported by this programme were almost entirely (95%) last mile infrastructure projects and nearly two thirds of the projects (65%) provided fibre optic service to the household or business. Grants in the first round could only support projects serving exclusively remote unserved rural areas but this requirement was dropped in the second round. However, a counterfactual for the employment of BIP-recipient tracts, if they had not received BIP investments, can be estimated using the employment of tracts that never received BIP investments. This assumes that the mean outcome observed for the tracts that never received BIP investments is the same as the mean outcome that would have been observed for the treated group if they had not received BIP. However, approximating the counterfactual level for BIP-recipient tracts by using non-recipient tracts, our estimates of the ATET are likely to be affected by selection bias due to the presence of observable or unobservable differences between the treated and never treated tracts that are associated with differences in outcomes. One drawback of PSM estimation alone is that it controls only for differences in observable characteristics of treated and control groups and not for unobservable differences. Selection bias can be further reduced by combining PSM with difference-in-difference (DiD) estimation, which estimates impacts of treatment on changes in the outcome variable between pre- and post-treatment periods, thus subtracting out the additive effects of fixed characteristics, whether observed or not. 7 Thus we combine PSM with DiD estimation. The primary data sources for the study are BIP data from the USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS), American Community Survey (ACS) data from the Census Bureau, Federal Communication Commission (FCC) data, and National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data from Walls & Associates. All the data used in the analysis are at the census tract level using Census 2010 tract boundaries. Digitized maps of BIP areas and other RUS broadband programmes were provided by RUS and used to identify the share of tracts that were in a BIP project service area or service areas of other broadband programmes. Census tract-level demographic, housing, and industry employment share information were obtained from the ACS. Tract-level broadband availability information was obtained from the FCC. All tract-level employment data were compiled from the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) data. The NETS is a longitudinal establishment-level database constructed by Walls & Associates using business-level data from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Market Identifier (DMI) files. Walls & Associates compiles repeated cross sections of the underlying D&B data on employment, sales and other variables into a longitudinal series using the unique D&B identification number (the DUNS number). They claim to cover nearly every US business unit that has operated in the United States over the past three decades, including sole proprietors, small privately owned firms, farms, nonprofit organizations and public sector establishments, such as post offices and public schools. Business data based on D&B DMI data have been criticized as not suitable for analysis (Davis et al., 1996). These criticisms claim that births and younger/smaller businesses are underreported and that there are discrepancies in the total U.S. employment figures in DMI files and data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, several more recent studies (Choi et al., 2013; Kunkle, 2011; Neumark et al., 2007, 2011) that investigated the accuracy of NETS data found fault with some of the above criticisms. Neumark et al. (2011) found that the claim of the underreporting of births in the NETS is without merit. They also claimed that the NETS data has better coverage of small business owners compared to those reported under the Statistics of Business (SOB) data. The main reason for the greater representation of smaller businesses in the NETS than in official business data sets is due to the inclusion of nonemployers in the NETS and imputing a value of 1 for the number of employees for nonemployer establishments. Most recently, Barnatchez et al. (2017) conducted a critical review of NETS data and concluded that the main discrepancies between NETS and official sources are largely driven by differences among small establishments and that NETS data greatly overrepresent establishments with less than 10 employees. They also highlighted issues with industry labeling that affect the comparability of results between the NETS and official business statistics and suggested that while the NETS is generally suitable for static analyses of establishments and employment across geographies or industries, it is less useful for studying business dynamics, though it is unclear how they arrived at this conclusion. RUS shape files of BIP project service areas 8 were overlaid on 2010 census tract boundaries using GIS software, 9 and the share of area of each census tract within BIP project service areas was computed. In our base analyses, we classified a census tract as ""treated"" by BIP if at least 90% of the tract area was in a BIP project service area. In robustness checks of our analysis, we investigate the robustness of our results to alternative thresholds of the minimum share of BIP area in a tract used to classify a tract as treated. All control tracts used in the analysis had no BIP project service areas intersecting the tract, and any tracts that included project service areas of any other RUS broadband programmes were excluded from the analysis. To implement the DiD/PSM design, treated tracts were defined in our base models as tracts with at least 90% of their area in a BIP project service area. 10 We selected a comparison group of tracts from among non-BIP areas. We excluded census tracts served by other USDA telecommunications programmes before matching and limited the control census tracts to those within 50 miles of the boundary of a treated tract.

Threatened evictions were measured at the county level using eviction case filing data obtained from The Eviction Lab (2008-2016). Additional economic and demographic data were obtained from the United States Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using 7.3 million births from 1,633 counties. We defined threatened eviction exposures as the z-score of average case filings over the pregnancy and by trimester. Our primary outcome was an indicator for preterm birth (born < 37 completed weeks of gestation). Secondary outcomes included a continuous measure for gestational length, a continuous measure for birth weight, and an indicator for low birth weight (born < 2500 g). We estimated within-county associations controlling for individual- and time-varying county-level characteristics, state-of-residence-year-and-month-of-conception fixed effects, and a county-specific time trend.We merged birth records with threatened eviction data at the county-month-year level using mother's county of residence at delivery and month-year of conception. We supplemented these data with information on county-level annual 18-and-over population, annual poverty rate, and monthly unemployment rate.Increased levels of eviction case filings over a pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight. These associations appeared to be sensitive to exposure in the second and third trimesters. Associations with secondary outcomes and within various population subgroups were, in general, imprecisely estimated.Higher exposure to eviction case filings within counties, particularly in the latter stages of a pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.

Few national studies of flourishing among school-aged children exist. Exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage is negatively associated with social and health outcomes, including flourishing. This analysis describes independent associations of the child, family, school, and neighborhood factors with flourishing, which we hypothesized may contribute to sociodemographic disparities.Data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health were used to examine parental perception of flourishing among school-aged children (6-17 years of age; n = 59,362). Flourishing was defined as curiosity about learning, resilience, and self-regulation. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between sociodemographic, child, family, school and neighborhood factors and flourishing were explored using χ tests and sequential logistic regression models.Overall, 48.4% of school-aged children were perceived by parents to be flourishing. There were significant sociodemographic disparities with non-Hispanic black children (37.4%) and those below the federal poverty level (37.9%) among the least likely to flourish. After adjustment, sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, child's age, physical activity, special health care needs status, adequate sleep, adverse childhood experiences, family meals, hours of television watched, extracurricular activities, school safety, neighborhood safety, neighborhood support, and presence of amenities were significantly associated with flourishing (p < 0.05). Disparities by poverty level and household structure were no longer significant.Addressing factors associated with parent-perceived flourishing including child, family, school and neighborhood factors such as physical activity, adequate sleep, and school/neighborhood safety may promote flourishing and reduce disparities.",2018,2018-03-09,35,Veni Kandasamy; Ashley H.

All analyses were weighted to account for the probability of selection and nonresponse and to reflect population counts of all noninstitutionalized US children residing in housing units.Developmental screening was measured through a validated set of 3 items indicating receipt in the past year of parent-completed screening from a health care professional with age-appropriate content regarding language development and social behavior. Surveillance was determined by an item capturing verbal elicitation of developmental concerns by a health care professional.Of the estimated 9.0 million children aged 9 through 35 months, an estimated 30.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-33.0%) were reported by their parent or guardian to have received a parent-completed developmental screening and 37.1% (95% CI, 34.4%-39.8%) were reported to have received developmental surveillance from a health care professional in the past year. Characteristics associated with screening and/or surveillance that remained significant after adjustment included primary household language, family structure, household education, income, medical home, past-year preventive visit, child health status, and special health care needs. Having health care that meets medical home criteria was significantly associated with both developmental screening (adjusted rate ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57) and surveillance (adjusted rate ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.42), representing an 8 to 9 absolute percentage point increase. State-level differences spanned 40 percentage points for screening (17.2% in Mississippi and 58.8% in Oregon) and surveillance (19.1% in Mississippi and 60.8% in Oregon), with approximately 90% of variation not explained by child and family characteristics.Despite more than a decade of initiatives, rates of developmental screening and surveillance remain low. However, state-level variation indicates continued potential for improvement.

However, reported estimates of the association between expenditures and IMR represented the degree to which the association changed each year, not the main effect. We reproduced the original results, reporting this main effect and replicated the analysis using improved methodology and updated data. METHODS For the reproduction analysis, we used methods and data identical to the original study: A publicly-posted, state-level data set of expenditures from 2000 to 2014 US Census Bureau survey data linked to 2-year lagged IMR data with a random intercept model including an interaction between time and expenditures. For the replication analysis, we added 5 years of data and adjusted for fixed state differences and inflation. RESULTS In the reproduction, the main effects of total, environmental, and educational expenditures on IMR were much larger than the interaction effects previously reported as the main effects. For example, a 1-SD increase in per-capita total expenditures was associated with a reduction of 0.35 infant deaths per 1000 live births instead of 0.02 deaths per 1000 live births originally reported. In the updated replication, the main effects were generally even larger (eg, −0.51 deaths per 1000 per SD increase in total expenditures). Increased total expenditures were associated with absolute but not relative reductions in Black–white IMR gaps.

We find that socioeconomic gentrification is uniformly associated with better birth outcomes. Notably, however, we find that only places specifically experiencing increases in non-White gentrification had this positive impact. These associations vary somewhat by maternal characteristics and by type of gentrification measure utilized; discrepancies between alternative measurement strategies are explored.

I use U.S. Census Bureau micro-data and the passage of the Lender Liability Act as a novel identification strategy to answer this question. Firms increase on-site pollution, cut investment in abatement technology, and incur 17.54% more environmental regulatory violations when secured lenders become less responsible for the cleanup cost of their collateral. The effects are stronger for firms close to bankruptcy or with high environmental risks. This lower environmental compliance slightly benefits employment, but does not change wages or production.

Using confidential employee–employer linked data in the legal services industry provided by the United States Census Bureau, we find evidence that inclusion of spinout team members from the founder's prior firm is positively related to spinout survival, a relationship which increases with included members' prior earnings. In contrast, we find that inclusion of spinout team members from firms outside the founder's prior firm is positively associated with spinout failure, a relationship which becomes statistically insignificant when included team members' prior earnings are high.

The U.S. Census Bureau and other survey data-collection organizations now systematically design interviewer observations with this purpose in mind. However, because these observations are typically estimates or judgments made by the interviewers, they may be incorrect. The effectiveness of nonresponse adjustments using these observations is hampered by such errors. Thus, knowledge about both household- and interviewer-level factors that affect the accuracy of interviewer observations is important for survey researchers in their efforts to design interviewer observations. To date, only one published study of a face-to-face household survey has attempted to identify these factors. This paper attempts to help fill this gap in knowledge by presenting multilevel models of the accuracy of a housing-unit observation recorded by interviewers in the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG): whether or not young children under the age of 15 are present in the household. The presence of children in the household is an important correlate of key variables in the NSFG and many other socio-economic surveys, and is related to survey participation in general. The accuracy of this observation was found to be a function of selected household-level factors and interactions between household- and interviewer-level factors. Implications of these results for practice and directions for future research are discussed.",2013,2013-06-01,33,Brady T.

We investigated the role of offense severity in accounting for these discrepancies.We hypothesized that severity would moderate racial differences in reporting, such that Black victims would be less likely to report less severe victimization but more likely to report more severe victimization. We expected that these differences would be less pronounced for bias-motivated crime, regardless of other markers of severity.We used data from the 2003-2016 National Crime Victimization Survey, including information on 21,510 victimization incidents, 1,105 of which were hate crimes. We conducted logistic regression analyses in which reporting was regressed on victim race, offense severity, hate crime status, and control variables. We also examined interactive effects to disentangle whether severity moderated racial differences in notification.We observed a three-way interaction of Black victims, offense severity, and hate crime status. Specifically, for nonbias incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report severe incidents, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonsevere incidents. Additionally, for nonsevere incidents, Black victims were more likely than White victims to report hate crimes, but there was no racial difference in reporting nonhate crimes.Offense severity plays an important role in the victim decision-making process. These patterns are different, however, by race and for hate crime victims, suggesting that people perceive hate crimes as important to report, regardless of their severity.

Results indicate that the co-offending is significantly and positively related to the likelihood of notification.

Illiquidity of owners’ investment and democratic governance may lead to underinvestment and managerial shirking in cooperative firms, both technical inefficiency sources, and the lack of a clear profit motive generates “inefficient” (relative to a profit-maximizing firm) economic decisions. This is especially true in the dairy product manufacturing sector, where production is capital intensive and factors leading to non-optimal investment decisions may have a large impact on efficiency. In this research we will use a unique dataset that includes plant level panel data for dairy product manufacturers from the Census of Manufactures encompassing the years 1977-2007 to determine whether there is a difference in plant level efficiency between cooperative firms and NCFs, as well as the source of any measured inefficiency.

I use a nationally representative survey, the American Community Survey (ACS), to examine a sample of homeowners who transitioned to adulthood during the first Gulf War and achieved their goal of paying off their mortgage and owning a single-family home. The data suggest an estimated one million of these homeowners (born between 1968 and 1973), including 30 thousand veterans. Even with their achievement, veteran homeownership is associated with lower home values than similar peers without military service. After controlling for demographic and housing characteristics, the comparisons show that the average differences in self-reported home values are ten percent lower than the comparison group. After reflecting on these findings and my decision to volunteer for the Marines in 1989, I find some encouraging news in the number of veterans who own a home without a mortgage and conclude that the average difference in home values would not have changed my decision to volunteer. However, throughout the project, I learned more about troubling social trends about trust in US institutions and recruiting challenges. I am concerned that these social trends—not differences in future homeownership wealth—may be the most menacing problem the US all-volunteer force has faced.",2024,2024-01-01,0,Brooks Depro,Elon University,Political and Economic history of UK and US,Journal of Veterans Studies,01,"Depro, Brooks. 2024.

This study uses data from the National Survey of College Graduates to examine whether parents’ socioeconomic status is related to their children’s student loan repayment after graduation. Holding the amount borrowed for completing higher education constant, college graduates with less educated parents hold a larger amount of educational debt in adulthood compared with their counterparts with more educated parents. The association between family background and student loan repayment remains significant with the addition of controls for various covariates related to college graduates’ education, occupation, income, and other labor market outcomes.

Using discrete funding-source information from the National Survey of College Graduates, this study offers the first exploration of the change in funding mixes across three cohorts — born in 1953–1962, 1963–1972, and 1973–1982 respectively — and their association with graduate degree attainment. The proportion of students who utilized only one or two funding sources decreased, while those who juggled three or more sources increased.

The second is a restricted-use micro-data archive containing 1.4 billion records from the censuses of 1940 to 2000. The new restricted-use archive is the product of a Census Bureau initiative to harmonize all of the bureau's decennial microdata and make them accessible through the Census Bureau Research Data Centers. The project will collaborate with the Census Bureau to create coding schemes to be used in both series that incorporate all detail in the restricted files.

However, the Census Bureau has not released nor plans to release research showing the impact of these changes. We explore the impact of the Census Bureau's procedural changes on the racial and ethnic distributions of the Hispanic (generally and by country of origin) and the American Indian and Alaska Native populations, the two populations most impacted by these changes. We use the 2019 and 2021 one-year ACS public-use microdata and 2019 and 2021 NCHS mortality data to compare racial distributions and estimate and compare select demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and mortality measures across the two years. Our results show that changes the Census Bureau implemented beginning with the 2020 decennial census and ACS appear to have had a significant impact on the comparability of Census Bureau race and ethnicity data. We find a significant data discontinuity impacting a wide variety of demographic, socioeconomic, and mortality statistics and analyses that rely on U.S. Census Bureau data as input for calculations. To mitigate these effects, methods that bridge race and ethnicity data between pre- and post-2020 census data are needed.

I study temporal trends and group-specific patterns in race and ancestry responses provided for children of interracial marriages. Common responses indicate contemporary definitions of race groups (and perhaps emerging groups); uncommon responses reveal socially defined limits of race group membership. I leverage dense, nonpublic, Census Bureau data from 1960 to 2010 to do this and include a more diverse set of families, a longer time span, and more accurate estimates than prior research. I find that the location of race group boundaries varies over time and across 11 distinct family types. Since mixed-heritage responses became possible in 1980, they have been common in most groups. Part Asians have almost always been reported as multiracial or mixed ancestry. A number of (non-Asian) mixed-heritage children are described as monoracial on the census form, particularly children with American Indian heritage. Over time, part whites are decreasingly reported as monoracially white (white race with no nonwhite ancestry). Black heritage is reported for part blacks, but monoracial black responses became nonmodal by 1980. Part Pacific Islanders show similarities to part Asians and part American Indians. Given the predominance of multiracial and mixed-ancestry Asian responses since 1980, Asian multiracial may be an emerging socially recognized race category. Black multiracial shows a similar pattern. Monoracial responses (especially common among white–American Indians and black–American Indians) create important but hard-to-measure complexity in groups’ compositions.",2016,2016-03-18,28,Carolyn A.

PLURAL makes use of the concept of ""remoteness"" to characterize the level of spatial isolation of a populated place with respect to its neighbors. There are two implementations of PLURAL, including (a) PLURAL-1, based on distances to the nearest places of user-specified population classes, and (b) PLURAL-2, based on neighborhood characterization derived from spatial networks. PLURAL requires simplistic input data, i.e., the coordinates (x,y) and population p of populated places (villages, towns, cities) in a given point in time. Due to its simplistic input, the PLURAL rural-urban classification scheme can be applied to historical data, as well as to data from data-scarce settings. Using the PLURAL framework, we created place-level rural-urban indices for the conterminous United States from 1930 to 2018. Rural-urban classifications are essential for analyzing geographic, demographic, environmental, and social processes across the rural-urban continuum. Most existing classifications are, however, only available at relatively aggregated spatial scales, such as at the county scale in the United States. The absence of rurality or urbanness measures at high spatial resolution poses significant problems when the process of interest is highly localized, as with the incorporation of rural towns and villages into encroaching metropolitan areas. Moreover, existing rural-urban classifications are often inconsistent over time, or require complex, multi-source input data (e.g., remote sensing observations or road network data), thus, prohibiting the longitudinal analysis of rural-urban dynamics. We developed a set of distance- and spatial-network-based methods for consistently estimating the remoteness and rurality of places at fine spatial resolution, over long periods of time. Based on these methods, we constructed indices of urbanness for 30,000 places in the United States from 1930 to 2018. We call these indices the place-level urban-rural index (PLURAL), enabling long-term, fine-grained analyses of urban and rural change in the United States. The method paper has been peer-reviewed and is published in ""Landscape and Urban Planning"". The PLURAL indices from 1930 to 2018 are available as CSV files, and as point-based geospatial vector data (.SHP). Moreover, we provide animated GIF files illustrating the spatio-temporal variation of the different variants of the PLURAL indices, illustrating the dynamics of the rural-urban continuum in the United States from 1930 to 2018. <strong>Apply the PLURAL rural-urban classification to your own data: </strong>Python code is fully open source and available at https://github.com/johannesuhl/plural. <strong>Data sources:</strong> Place-level population counts (1980-2010) and place locations 1930 - 2018 were obtained from IPUMS NHGIS, (University of Minnesota, www.nhgis.org; Manson et al. 2022).

Furthermore, we augment the model with administrative tax data to test for nonignorable nonresponse. Using data from 2009, 2011, and 2013, we find that the current hot deck imputation used by the Census Bureau produces different distribution statistics, downward for poverty and inequality and upward for median income, relative to the SRMI model-based estimates. Our results suggest that these differences are a result of match bias, not nonignorable nonresponse. Nearly all poverty, median income, and inequality estimates are not significantly different when comparing imputation models with and without administrative data. However, there are clear efficiency gains from using administrative data.",2020,2020-07-21,2,Charles Hokayem; Trivellore E.

Although birth and death rates influence a population, the key contributing factor influencing the demographics of a locality is almost always internal migration—the movement of persons between U.S. regions, states, and localities. Current definitions of internal migration used by the U.S. Census Bureau are limited because confidentiality restrictions require that detailed current and former place of residence geographic information be suppressed in publicly available files. In this paper we report the results of our work with confidential versions of the 1990 and 2000 decennial census microdata to develop an improved measurement of migration in order to develop a profile of internal migration in the United States. We perform our analysis for two contrasting time periods, 1985–1990 and 1995–2000. Our interest here is to assess the stability of the profile of migrants during a time period of economic contraction and expansion. Using confidential internal versions of the 1990 and 2000 Census long-form microdata, we estimate logistic models of the likelihood that individuals will migrate. The geographic detail in the internal Census data permits us to measure migration in ways that are not possible with public-domain Census data on persons. We develop migration definitions that distinguish between local residential mobility likely associated with life course transitions from migration out of the labor market area that may be driven more by employment and other socioeconomic considerations. Using logistic modeling, we find that the same individual attributes predict migration reasonably well during both periods. We also compute some illustrative probabilities of migration that show temporal stability in migration predictors could be lessened by certain changes in population composition.",2009,2009-09-01,11,Charles M.

We use multilevel logistic regression models to predict the effects of community bank presence within the CZ on the odds of using a bank business loan to start or expand a business for nonmetropolitan businesses started or purchased since 2000. Net of important characteristics of the businesses and owners, we find that the greater the proportion of local banks in a nonmetropolitan CZ, the greater the odds that a conventional business loan was used to either help start a new business or expand an existing business.",2017,2017-07-28,5,F.

To understand these nonmetropolitan offset counties, we use confidential Census Bureau data that offer us the detailed geography and larger sample size needed to closely examine spatial shifts in the foreign born population, especially those recently arrived.

Substantial fractions of the U.S. labor force have children at home and will likely face obstacles to returning to work if childcare options remain closed.

This strategy allows me to disentangle the influence of house prices from that of other time-varying, location-specific shocks. Estimates show that homeowners who have experienced declines in the nominal value of their home are approximately 20% less likely to take a new job in a location outside of the metropolitan area that they currently live and work in, relative to an equivalent renter.

Results from a hazard analysis confirm the importance of many of the determinants of migration posited in the literature, such as age, education, and local labor market conditions. While simple averages and OLS estimates indicate that migrating for a new job reduces the probability of re-employment within a given time frame and lengthens the spell of unemployment in the aggregate, after controlling for selection into migration using an IV approach based on local house price changes, the results suggest that out-migrating for employment actually has a large and significant beneficial effect of shortening the time to re-employment.

By combining administrative data on sole proprietors and their businesses with quarterly administrative data on wage and salary jobs held by the same individuals both preceding and concurrent with business startup, we create the unique opportunity to quantify significant workforce dynamics that have up to now remained unobserved. The data allow us to take a first glimpse at these business owners as they initiate business ventures and make the transition from wage and salary work to business ownership and back. We find that the barrier between wage and salary work and self-employment is extremely fluid, with large flows occurring in both directions. We also observe that a large fraction of business owners takeon both roles simultaneously and find that this labor market diversification does have implications for the success of the businesses these owners create. The results for employer transitions to exit and non-employer suggest that there is a ""don't quit your day job"" effect that is present for new businesses. Employers are more likely to stay employers if they have a wage and salary job in the year just prior to the transitions that we are tracking. It is especially important to have a stable wage and salary job but there is also evidence that higher earnings from the wage and salary job makes transition less likely. For nonemployers we find roughly similar patterns but there are some key differences. We find that having recent wage and salary income (and having higher earnings from such wage and salary activity) increases the likelihood of survival. Having recent stable wage and salary income decreases the likelihood of a complete exit but increases the likelihood of transiting to be an employer. Having recent wage and salary income in the same industry as the non-employer business has a large and positive impact on the likelihood of transiting to being a non-employer business.",2013,2013-01-01,5,Mónica García-Pérez; Christopher Goetz; John Haltiwanger; Kristin Sandusky,"St. Cloud State University; Government of the United States of America; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA - Institute of Labor Economics; University of Maryland, College Park; Government of the United States of America",Firm Innovation and Growth; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Corporate Finance and Governance,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"García-Pérez, Mónica; Goetz, Christopher; Haltiwanger, John; Sandusky, Kristin. 2013.

One exception to this outsourcing premia is that wages tend to be the same for both outsourcers and non-outsourcers. Second, outsourcing firms, but not plants, have significantly higher productivity growth.",2005,2005-11-01,9,C Kurz,Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Board of Governors,Global trade and economics; International Business and FDI; Outsourcing and Supply Chain Management,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,11,"Kurz, C. 2005.

The negative relationship with diversity was also replicated on a different Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit attitudes to disability, but the interaction with segregation was again insignificant.

While many previous analyses have relied on a unidimensional model of hardship, we argue that this is not conceptually and empirically sufficient. Instead, we compare the standard unidimensional account of hardship to a model that contrasts hardship related to physical necessities and hardship in less critical areas, two models contrasting hardships due to short-term constraints and those with longer time horizons, and finally, a model that posits each nominal type of hardship is best represented by its own latent construct. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 and 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U.S. Census Bureau 2001, 2004), we estimate confirmatory factor analyses, which suggest that a model of hardship that separates different dimensions—health, food, bill paying, and housing hardship—fits this data better than any of the other conceptual models tested. This finding suggests strongly that the four aspects of material hardship modeled here, though obviously associated, are best understood as arising from processes and structures that are not identical.

The goal was to reduce the cost of the fieldwork in the Nonresponse Follow-up (NRFU). The original plan had NRFU beginning in mid-May and continuing through late July. However, the pandemic forced the delay of NRFU and caused the Internal Revenue Service to postpone the income tax filing deadline, resulting in an interruption in the delivery of ARs to the U.S. Census Bureau. The delays were not anticipated when U.S. Census Bureau staff conducted the research on AR enumeration with the 2010 Census data in preparation for the 2020 Census or during the fine tuning of plans for using ARs during the 2018 Census Test. These circumstances raised questions about whether the quality of the AR household rosters was high enough for use in enumeration. To aid in investigating the concern about the quality of the AR rosters, this study compares census rosters to AR rosters that meet a quality standard at addresses that have both and the census roster is either a self-response or a NRFU household member response. A key result is that the mode of census response and the amount of time between the response and the April 1 st reference date impacts the agreement rate between AR roster size and the census roster size at addresses that have both types of rosters.",2024,2024-02-01,0,Mary H.

The level of education is consistently reported as higher than it is (errors are not mean 0), errors in the reporting of education are correlated with covariates that appear in earnings regressions, and errors in the reporting of education appear correlated with the error term in a model of earnings determination.

We pay special attention to differences by race/ethnicity and by homeownership – a proxy for wealth. Our results suggest that (1) some types of social insurance receipt are a weak substitute for informal financial support, (2) the substitution between informal financial support and social insurance receipt is stronger among White households than households of color, and (3) wealth is a more consistent buffer against financial hardship than social insurance receipt.KEYWORDS: Race and ethnicitysocial insuranceinformal financial supportwealth gap Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.Data availability statementThe data that support the findings of this study are openly available at the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey Data: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/datasets.html. Replication STATA do files are available on Harvard Dataverse at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/CIDZ6T.Notes1 The characteristics of respondents with missing observations typically do not vary from the overall sample.2 We estimated the models based on the sample without imputed observations as well. Our regression estimates are not materially different from the one based on the sample with imputed observations.3 The conclusions hold if we use other financial insecurity measures such as food insufficiency or being behind on rent or mortgage payments.4 The HPS is a household survey, but all statistics are reported using personal weight as is the case for public summary data tables based on U.S. Census Bureau (Citation2022). We use the term people and households interchangeably in this paper. The conclusions do not change if we use household weights instead of personal weights.5 Authors' calculations based on U.S. Census Bureau (Citation2022).6 All calculations in this paragraph based on Fed (2022). We combine data for 2020 and 2021 to have sufficiently large sample sizes by race and ethnicity. The combination of years of data does not impact our conclusions.7 We do not report the average share of people receiving EIP payments since that number is meaningless in repeated cross sections. Each household only received a one-time payment in the spring of 2021, unlike ongoing CTC or UI payments. A large share of households received EIP checks early in the spring, while some taxpayers waited well into the spring to get theirs. Taking an average across all recipients recorded in the HPS would indicate an artificially low share of people with such checks.8 Figure A1 in the appendix summarizes EIP receipt by HPS week, race and ethnicity. The share of Black and Latino recipients is generally larger than the share of White recipients across all weeks.9 Calculations based on the HPS show that 27.1 percent of homeowners saved their EIP checks, while 19.3 percent of renters did. Also, 33.7 percent of homeowners saved their CTC checks, while 18.2 percent of renters did. Authors calculations based on Census (Citation2022).10 Calculations based on Fed (2022). Correlations with other measures of access to liquid savings show similarly large gaps between renters and homeowners.11 In all instances, the parameter estimates for the other correlates are either statistically insignificant or have the expected sign.12 Combined effects are the exponentiated odds ratios of the sum of the two parameters or the product of the two odds ratios.13 This difference holds for all months in the first half of 2021, when data for EIP receipt are available.14 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022).15 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022)16 Authors' calculations based on Census (Citation2022).Additional informationNotes on contributorsDania V.

We combine new data on oil and gas endowments with Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms affect local economies in the U.S. Local wages rise during oil and gas booms, but manufacturing is not crowded out—in fact, the sector grows overall, driven by upstream and locally-traded subsectors. Tradable manufacturing subsectors do contract during resource booms, but their productivity is unaffected, so there is no evidence of foregone local learning-by-doing effects. Over the full 1969–2014 sample, a county with one standard deviation additional oil and gas endowment averaged about 1% higher real wages.

Enrollments are surging in anticipation of a large physician shortfall; meanwhile, many anatomists are reaching retirement age. Who will fill the teaching gap? This study assessed trends in doctorates awarded in Anatomy and related fields within the United States (US) since 1969 and evaluated modern graduate education in the anatomical sciences. Data were compiled from the National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates. The total number of doctorates in the anatomical sciences and number of doctorates by sex and race/ethnicity were plotted for trend analysis. The number of PhD anatomy training programs within US medical schools was also assessed. Curricula and major characteristics of all active programs were evaluated through website searches and program director interviews. While doctorates in cell biology, developmental biology, and neuroscience have grown, the number of PhDs awarded in Anatomy has declined, on average, by 3.1 graduates per year to a 50-year low of only 8 graduates in 2017. Currently, 21 active doctoral programs in anatomy operate within US medical schools and fall into three general categories: anatomy education (n = 8), classic anatomy (n = 8), and anthropology/evolutionary anatomy (n = 5).

736.0,Completed,Analysis of the Child Care Market in the United States,Berkeley,2009.0,2014.0,Maria D Fitzpatrick,Update on the state of the anatomy educator shortage,editorial,published,2023.0,16,6,1118-1120,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2303,Update on the state of the anatomy educator shortage,"Anatomy education is a cornerstone of health professions education. With the expansive growth of graduate and health professions programs, increased student enrollments, and the advancement of new medical techniques and technologies, the demand for anatomy education is robust. At the time of this editorial, within the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico there were 330 masters level nursing programs ((AACN) AAoCoN, n.d.), 329 speech-language pathology programs (CAA, n.d.), 300 physician assistant programs (ARC-PA, n.d.), 300 physical therapy programs (CAPTE, n.d.), 248 occupational therapy programs (ACOTE, n.d.), 198 osteopathic and allopathic medicine programs (LCME, n.d.; Association AO, n.d.), 70 dental medicine programs (CODA, n.d.), and 32 veterinary medicine programs (Association AVM, n.d.). Anatomy curricula, in some form, are common among these most popular health professions programs. However, with a limited supply of anatomy educators entering the workforce (Wilson et al., 2020, 2021; Edwards et al., 2022), hiring well-qualified individuals to teach the anatomical sciences is presently a challenge. The identified supply and demand mismatch has brought anatomy job market trends into the limelight and raises the question, “Are we, as a profession, equipped to meet the current and future needs of the health education market?” The anatomy educator shortage was first reported in 1961 when Eldred and Eldred observed an imbalance in teaching faculty as the number of medical schools expanded (Eldred & Eldred, 1961). In 2002, 41 years later, a national survey found that more than 80% of chairpersons anticipated difficulty in recruiting and hiring qualified anatomy educators (Holden, 2003). More recent reports, as of 2020, have explored the anatomy educator shortage from a variety of viewpoints including chairperson perspectives (Wilson et al., 2020), American Association for Anatomy (AAA) annual job posting outcomes (Wilson et al., 2020), National Science Foundation (NSF) outcomes from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (Wilson et al., 2021), and AAA membership retirement intentions (Edwards et al., 2022). Collectively, this information points to a continued and widening shortage of anatomy educators. Over the past seven years, from 2016 to 2022, AAA job postings for anatomy educators have increased by 60% at an average rate of six additional postings per year (Figure 1; R2 = 0.56). In 2022, the AAA job board hosted 128 openings for anatomy educator positions across US and Canadian medical, health professions, and undergraduate institutions (Figure 1). These 128 postings for anatomy educator positions were collated from a larger list of 184 AAA job postings. Duplicate postings were defined as postings for the same position, at the same institution, that were posted over multiple sequential time periods throughout the course of the year. Duplicate postings and positions for postdoctoral trainees, chairpersons, administrators, basic science researchers, clinical positions, or adjunct/part-time faculty were excluded from the analysis. Fewer job postings in 2020 were likely a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Edwards et al., 2022). The proportion of schools that have posted job openings consecutively from one year to the next has remained relatively constant over time and has not exceeded 25% of the total number of postings (Figure 2). As such, most job postings each year represented new/unique openings. The job advertisements posted across consecutive years predominately represented postings that first opened late in the calendar year (e.g., November) and lingered as unfilled positions into the next calendar year. Limited information in the AAA dataset prevented clear delineation between new versus lingering unfilled positions across consecutive years. Changes to the AAA job posting intake form are needed to yield a richer and more precise dataset. Additionally, a separate future analysis is needed to discern why certain schools take longer to fill their open positions than others, a possible byproduct of geographic characteristics, institutional factors, and the selectivity of searching anatomists (i.e., it is currently an employee's market). Based on job postings alone, the current market suggests a positive outlook for the future of the anatomy education job market. Previously, Wilson et al. reported a 5-year forecast, through 2025, regarding the number of PhD graduates expected to enter the workforce based on NSF data and the number of graduates that would be needed for the profession to reestablish a state of homeostasis (i.e., an equilibrium in the supply versus demand) (Wilson et al., 2021). Since this report, the number of PhD graduates reported by 62% (13 of 21) of active anatomy PhD programs has closely mirrored the projected estimate of 22 graduates per year (Figure 3). While 2023 is anticipated to yield at least 30 PhD anatomy graduates, these numbers (from 2020 to 2023; Figure 3) still fall short of the forecasted need of 40 to 51 graduates per year, through 2025. These forecasts did not account for faculty retirements, which now are estimated at approximately 40 per year, through at least 2026 (Edwards et al., 2022). Although job posting increases suggest a positive outlook for the profession, the trickling pipeline of anatomy PhD graduates entering the workforce is barely able to keep pace with faculty retirements, let alone fill the needs of new and expanding programs (Edwards et al., 2022). According to the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates dataset, over a three-year period, from 2019 to 2021, 20 different schools graduated at least one individual with a PhD in anatomy. The additional need to staff new programs, and existing programs with increased enrollments, will inevitably place further strain on the anatomy educator shortage. These outcomes suggest that within the foreseeable future, unless deliberate actions are taken and sustainable streams of financial support are identified, the supply of PhD-trained anatomists will continue to trail behind the growing health professions' demand for anatomy education. Without an adequate supply of anatomy educators, departments may come to rely more heavily on retirees, masters-trained individuals, and/or faculty from other related disciplines, which has the potential to increase demands for additional professional development (Wilson et al., 2018). While similar supply and demand misalignments may be occurring internationally, this dataset cannot be generalized to health education markets in other countries. The outcomes reported herein relied solely on the AAA job board. These numbers may be underestimates of the job market demand as they may not fully capture open positions posted through other sources. Future investigations that include data from additional job boards (e.g., American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA), Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS)) are needed to ensure a more comprehensive assessment of the anatomy education job market. Continued annual monitoring of the anatomy educator job market is necessary for identifying gaps and recognizing areas for improvement. However, simply tracking numbers without strategically developing and implementing a solution to reverse the shortage is not enough. To use an analogy, we must not allow a “threatened” species to become “endangered” without considering a need for intervention. To make a concerted effort to reverse the anatomy educator shortage will require input, cooperation, and coordination between anatomy PhD programs, departments, and professional associations. Instead of merely pontificating about the anatomy educator shortage, we must actively work to devise practical solutions to help turn the tide. Remaining idle at this critical juncture and failing to capitalize on our profession's unique growth opportunity will only result in stagnation within our community and perhaps a further loss of identity among anatomists.

Results Over the study period, 1,783 fatal occupational injuries were identified among non‐Latino/a workers and 259 fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers in North Carolina. The majority of fatal occupational injuries among Latino/a workers occurred among males employed in construction and agriculture. While the fatal occupational injury rate among Latino/a workers declined over the study period, the rate among Latino/a workers was higher than among non‐Latino/a White and Black workers; moreover, fatal occupational injury rates for Latino/a workers trended upwards during the most recent years of the study period.

However, given the relatively small sample size of the CPS, analyses that examine the cross-classification of occupation or industry with demographic or geographic characteristics will often produce highly imprecise rate estimates. The Decennial Census of Population provides an alternative source for rate denominator information. We investigate the comparability of fatal injury rates derived using these two sources of rate denominator information.Information on fatal occupational injuries that occurred between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1994 was obtained from the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality surveillance system. Annual estimates of employment by occupation, industry, age, and sex were derived from the CPS, and by linear interpolation and extrapolation from the 1980 and 1990 Census of Population. Fatal injury rates derived using these denominator data were compared.Fatal injury rates calculated using Census-based denominator data were within 10% of rates calculated using CPS data for all major occupation groups except farming/forestry/fishing, for which the fatal injury rate calculated using Census-based denominator data was 24.69/100,000 worker-years and the rate calculated using CPS data was 19.97/100,000 worker-years. The choice of denominator data source had minimal influence on estimates of trends over calendar time in the fatal injury rates for most major occupation and industry groups.The Census offers a reasonable source for deriving fatal injury rate denominator data in situations where the CPS does not provide sufficiently precise data, although the Census may underestimate the population-at-risk in some industries as a consequence of seasonal variation in employment.",2004,2004-08-11,17,David B.

This paper reports the characteristics of sport and recreation-related (SR) emergency department (ED) visits among school-age children and youth in a statewide population.This study included all injury-related visits made to all North Carolina 24/7 acute-care civilian hospital-affiliated EDs by school-age youth, 5-18 years of age, during 2010-2014 (N = 918,662). Population estimates were based on US decennial census data. Poisson regression methods were used to estimate incidence rates and rate ratios.During the five-year period, there were 767,075 unintentional injury-related ED visits among school-age youth, of which 213,518 (27.8%) were identified as SR injuries. The average annual absolute number and incidence rate (IR) of SR ED visits among school-age youth was 42,704 and 2374.5 ED visits per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 2364.4-2384.6), respectively. In comparison to other unintentional injuries among school-age youth, SR ED visits were more likely to be diagnosed with an injury to the upper extremity (Injury Proportion Ratio [IPR] = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.27-1.29), the lower extremity (IPR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15), and a TBI or other head/neck/facial injury (IPR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.11-1.13). Among ED visits made by school-age youth, the leading cause of SR injury was sports/athletics played as a group or team. The leading cause of team sports/athletics injury was American tackle football among boys and soccer among girls. The proportion of ED visits diagnosed with a TBI varied by age and sex, with 15-18 year-olds and boys having the highest population-based rates.Sports and recreational activities are an important component of a healthy lifestyle, but they are also a major source of injury morbidity among school-age youth.

In North Carolina, the population of older workers more than doubled between 2000 and 2017. In 2008, the Great Recession changed occupational patterns among all age groups. We examined annual rates and distribution of fatal occupational injuries experienced by older workers, comparing the pre-recession period (2000–2007) to the post-recession period (2009–2017). Methods Detailed information on all fatal occupational injuries during the period between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 were abstracted from the records of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the office of vital records. The decennial Census and American Community Survey were used to estimate the population at risk and derive annual rates of fatal occupational injury. Results During the study period, 537 occupational fatalities occurred among workers 55+ years of age. The rate of fatal occupational injury among older workers declined 2.8% per year, with a 7.7% yearly decline in the pre-recession period compared with a 1.4% increase per year in the post-recession period. Workers 65+ years of age experienced rate increases in both periods. The highest rates of unintentional fatal occupational injury (injuries that were not purposefully inflicted) were observed in forestry, fishing hunting and trapping, and wood building manufacturing. Intentional fatal occupational injury rates (homicide, suicide) were highest in transportation, gas/service stations and grocery/food stores.

The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72% of census tracts, the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article presents a heuristic spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to a user-specified threshold.",2015,2015-02-27,82,Seth Spielman; David C.

Since ACS data are estimates rather than actual counts, they contain a degree of statistical uncertainty—referred to as margin of error (MOE)—that planners must navigate when using these data. The statistical uncertainty is magnified when one is working with data for small areas or subgroups of the population or cross-tabulating demographic characteristics. We interviewed (n = 7) and surveyed (n = 200) planners and find that many do not understand the statistical uncertainty in ACS data, find it difficult to communicate statistical uncertainty to stakeholders, and avoid reporting MOEs altogether. These practices may conflict with planners' ethical obligations under the AICP Code of Ethics to disclose information in a clear and direct way.Takeaway for practice: We argue that the planning academy should change its curriculum requirements and that the profession should improve professional development training to ensure planners understand data uncertainty and convey it to users. We suggest planners follow 5 guidelines when using ACS data: Report MOEs, indicate when they are not reporting MOEs, provide context for the level of statistical reliability, consider alternatives for reducing statistical uncertainty, and always conduct statistical tests when comparing ACS estimates.",2018,2018-04-03,23,Jason R.

In the United States, the official poverty measure considers only a person's income, although poverty is increasingly understood internationally as a set of multiple, interlinked deprivations. This article introduces a decomposable multidimensional poverty (MDP) measure that addresses these shortcomings by using thirteen American Community Survey microdata indicators to identify education, health, housing, and economic security deprivations for individuals. In 2017, the national poverty rate was 13.7 percent when measured using MDP and 13.1 percent using official poverty. Although similar at the national scale, Hispanic, Asian, and older persons had higher poverty rates using the multidimensional measure, whereas Black and young persons had higher rates when using official poverty. MDP tended to be higher than official poverty in dense urban areas, whereas official poverty tended to be higher in rural areas. Further, MDP was a stronger correlate with COVID-19 death rates than official poverty through the first three waves of the pandemic. The design of MDP recognizes that individuals can experience poverty in different ways and provides a more holistic view of people and places.",2023,2023-11-06,3,David C.

This article focuses on some of the key research findings of the eight nodes, organized into six topics: (1) improving census and survey data-quality and data collection methods; (2) using alternative sources of data; (3) protecting privacy and confidentiality by improving disclosure avoidance; (4) using spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling to improve estimates; (5) assessing data cost and data-quality tradeoffs; and (6) combining information from multiple sources.

Decades of research confirm that variation in how individuals are aggregated into geographic units can dramatically alter analyses conducted with these units. While most researchers are aware of the problem, they have lacked the tools to determine its magnitude or its capacity to affect analytical results obtained using these contextual measures. Using confidential access to the complete 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, we can construct—for all persons in the U.S.—individual‐specific contexts, which we group according to Census‐assigned block, block group, and tract. We compare these individual‐specific measures to the published statistics at each scale, and we then determine the degree to which published measures could be affected by how boundaries are drawn using a simple statistic, the standard deviation of individual context (SDIC). For three key measures (percent Black, percent Hispanic, and Entropy—a measure of ethno‐racial diversity), we find that block‐level Census statistics frequently contain a high degree of uncertainty meaning that they may not capture the actual context of individuals within them. More problematic, we uncover systematic spatial patterns in the uncertainty associated with contextual variables at all three scales.",2019,2019-02-21,32,Christopher S. Fowler; Nathan Frey; David C.

Incorporating perceived best practices from previous initiatives, the CCTC combines explicit eligibility thresholds with some discretion on the part of program officials to select tax credit recipients. The structure and implementation of the program facilitates rigorous evaluation. We exploit detailed data on accepted and rejected applicants to the CCTC, including information on the scoring of applicants with regard to program goals as well as on funding decisions, together with restricted-access American Community Survey (ACS) data on local economic conditions. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that each CCTC-incentivized job in a census tract increases the number of individuals working in that tract by close to 3 – a significant local multiplier. Local multipliers are larger for non-manufacturing awards than for manufacturing awards. CCTC awards increase employment among workers across socioeconomic groups and in more- as well as less-advantaged neighborhoods, but have limited impact on residents of affected communities. We validate our empirical strategy and confirm our core results using an alternative dataset and recently developed difference-in-differences methods that correct for potential biases generated by variation in treatment timing and treatment effect heterogeneity.",2022,2022-12-13,10,Matthew Freedman; Shantanu Khanna; David Neumark,Northeastern University,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies",Journal of Public Economics,12,"Freedman, Matthew; Khanna, Shantanu; Neumark, David. 2022.

We operationalized neighborhoods using census tracts, with 65,655 of them nested within 3,015 counties, nested within 49 states. We linked census track life table data for ages 45-74 (n=196,965) from the National Vital Statistics System with 5-year population estimates (2011-2015) stratified by race/ethnicity and income from the American Community Survey. We measured racial/ethnic and income segregation using the Index of Concentration of the Extremes at the census tract level, and the indexes of dissimilarity and exposure at the county level. Using three-level random intercept models, we assessed the direct and contextual relationship between survival at ages 45-74 with racial/ethnic and income segregation. Regardless of racial/ethnic stratification, a high concentration of neighborhood poverty was associated with a lower probability of survival relative to affluent neighborhoods (−4.83%; 95% CI −4.86, −4.79), although the relationship was larger in neighborhoods with high concentration of Blacks (−5.61%; −5.67, −5.54). Black-white county-level unevenness also had the largest negative association in those neighborhoods (−0.26%; −0.32, −0.20). Furthermore, Black isolation was negatively associated with a lower survival probability (−0.21%; −0.29, −0.13), but Hispanic isolation was positively associated (0.23%; 0.16, 0.30). Opposite relationships resulted from Black-White (0.06; −0.01, 0.14) and Hispanic-White (−0.13; −0.21, −0.05) interactions. Finally, high exposure to neighborhood poverty/affluence was associated with lower/higher probability of neighborhood survival, but the associations were the strongest for Blacks. Significance Racial/ethnic and income residential segregation have been associated with negative health outcomes and increased risk of mortality in the U.S. We tested the association between residential segregation at different geographic levels with the survival probability at ages 45-74 across rural/urban neighborhoods. Results indicate that the racial/ethnic and income geographic composition of the population are important factors for explaining this relationship. That is, poverty concentration, minority-white unevenness, and exposure to poverty, had detrimental outcomes for all communities, irrespective of their racial/ethnic composition. However, while minority-isolation/-exposure to whites is detrimental/protective for Black communities, the opposite happened in Hispanic communities. Our research provides important insights in understanding the extent to which residential segregation explains survival disparities across neighborhoods based on their race/ethnicity composition.",2020,2020-08-24,0,Iván Mejía‐Guevara; Mark R.

Motivated by intuitions from factor‐proportions‐inspired work on offshoring and heterogeneous firms in trade, we build industry‐level measures of import competition. Combining worker data from the Longitudinal Employer‐Household Dynamics data set, detailed establishment information from the Census of Manufactures and transaction‐level trade data, we find that rising import competition from China and other developing economies increases the likelihood of job loss among manufacturing workers with less than a high school degree; it is not significantly related to job losses for workers with at least a college degree.",2014,2014-11-12,14,Thomas Kemeny; David L.

The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by “database reconstruction,” a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.",2021,2021-08-22,32,Steven Ruggles; David Van Riper,University of Minnesota; University of Minnesota,Privacy-Preserving Technologies in Data; Housing Market and Economics; Census and Population Estimation,Population Research and Policy Review,08,"Ruggles, Steven; Riper, David Van. 2021.

We explore whether, in the face of falling central city crime rates, households with more resources and options were more likely to move into central cities overall and more particularly into low income and/or majority minority central city neighborhoods. We use confidential, geocoded versions of the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census and the 2010, 2011, and 2012 American Community Survey to track moves to different neighborhoods in 244 Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and their largest central cities. Our dataset includes over four million household moves across the three time periods. We focus on three household types typically considered gentrifiers: high-income, college-educated, and white households. We find that declines in city crime are associated with increases in the probability that high income and college-educated households choose to move into central city neighborhoods, including low-income and majority minority central city neighborhoods. Moreover, we find little evidence that households with lower incomes and without college degrees are more likely to move to cities when violent crime falls. These results hold during the 1990s as well as the 2000s and for the 100 largest metropolitan areas, where crime declines were greatest. There is weaker evidence that white households are disproportionately drawn to cities as crime falls in the 100 largest metropolitan areas from 2000 to 2010.",2017,2017-01-01,19,Ingrid Gould Ellen; Keren Mertens Horn; Davin Reed,Wagner College; New York University; University of Massachusetts Boston; Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing Market and Economics; Crime Patterns and Interventions",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Ellen, Ingrid Gould; Horn, Keren Mertens; Reed, Davin. 2017.

First, do VCs indeed improve the efficiency (total factor productivity, TFP) of private firms, and if so, are certain kinds of VCs (high reputation vs. low reputation) better at generating such efficiency gains than others? Second, do VCs invest in more efficient firms to begin with (screening), or do they improve efficiency after investment (monitoring)? Third, do efficiency improvements due to VC backing arise from increases in sales or reductions in costs? Fourth, does VC backing and the associated efficiency gains affect the probability of a successful exit (IPO or acquisition)? Our analysis shows that the overall efficiency of VC-backed firms is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms at every point in time. This efficiency advantage of VC-backed firms arises from both screening and monitoring: the efficiency of VC-backed firms prior to receiving financing is higher than that of non-VC-backed firms, and further, the growth in efficiency subsequent to VC financing is greater for such firms. The above increases in efficiency of VC-backed firms are spread over the first two rounds of VC financing after which the TFP of such firms remains constant until exit. Additionally, we show that while the TFP of firms prior to receiving financing is lower for high-reputation VC-backed firms, the increase in TFP subsequent to financing is significantly greater for these firms, consistent with high-reputation VCs having greater monitoring ability. We disentangle the screening and monitoring effects of VC backing using three different methodologies: switching regression with endogenous switching, regression discontinuity analysis, and propensity score matching.

A spin-off refers to the separation of the management of some assets of a firm into a separate entity (which we term as the spun-off entity or subsidiary). Using treatment effect estimators and propensity score matching in our analysis, we identify, how (the precise channel and mechanism), where (parent or subsidiary), and when (the dynamic pattern) efficiency improvements arise following spin-offs. We show that spin-offs increase total factor productivity (TFP) and that such productivity improvements are long-lived. This post spin-off productivity improvement can be attributed to cost savings but not to higher sales and arise primarily in plants remaining with the parent. However, contrary to speculation in the previous literature, we show that plants that are spun-off do not underperform parent plants prior to the spin-off. We identify acquisitions following spin-offs and find that while productivity improvements occur immediately after the spin-off in the non-acquired plants, in the acquired plants they start only after being taken over by another firm.

The changes must build on the successes and address the challenges of the previous censuses. Of particular interest is to gauge the on-going quality of the census frames. We address this topic by discussing a set of statistical models for the Master Address File that will produce estimates of coverage error at levels of geography down to the block level. The distributions of added and deleted housing units in a block are used to characterize the undercoverage and overcoverage respectively. The data used are from the 2010 address canvassing operation.

We utilize an approach that has been well-studied to approximate tolerance intervals for the binomial and Poisson settings, which is based on the confidence interval for the parameter in the respective distribution. A simulation study is performed to assess the coverage probabilities and expected widths of the tolerance intervals. The simulation study also compares eight different confidence interval approaches for the negative binomial proportions. We recommend using those in practice that perform the best based on our simulation results. The method is also illustrated using two real data examples.Keywords: confidence intervalcoverage probabilityexpected widthfiducial inferenceinverse samplingsaddle-point approximationAMS Subject Classifications: 62D0562F25 AcknowledgementsWe thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful comments pertaining to this manuscript.Notes† Disclaimer: This report is released to inform interested parties of research, to encourage discussion.

Usually, some sort of dimension reduction strategy is employed. Classic strategies are often in the form of traditional inference procedures, such as hypothesis testing; however, the increase in computing capabilities has led to the development of more sophisticated methods. In particular, sufficient dimension reduction has emerged as an area of broad and current interest. While these types of dimension reduction strategies have been employed for numerous data problems, they are scantly discussed in the context of analyzing survey data. This paper provides an overview of some classic and modern dimension reduction methods, followed by a discussion of how to use the transformed variables in the context of analyzing survey data. We highlight some of these methods with an analysis of health insurance coverage using the US Census Bureau's 2015 Planning Database.",2017,2017-12-01,26,Jiaying Weng; Derek S.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the most common urban/rural definitions (Census Bureau, OMB, RUCA, and Isolation) and determine which is preferable for explaining the geographic distribution of several tobacco-related outcomes (behavior, receiving a doctor's advice to quit, and support for secondhand smoke policies). Methods: Data came from The Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplement. For each tobacco-related outcome, one logistic regression was conducted for each urban/rural measure. Models were then ranked according to their ability to explain the data using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: Each definition provided very different estimates for the prevalence of the U.S. population that is considered ""rural"" (e.g., 5.9% for the OMB, 17.0% for the Census Bureau). The OMB definition was most sensitive at detecting urban/rural differences, followed by the Isolation scale. Both these measures use strict, less-inclusive criteria for what constitutes ""rural."" Conclusions: Overall, results demonstrate the heterogeneity across urban/rural measures. Although findings do not provide a definitive answer for which urban/rural definition is the best for examining rural tobacco use, they do suggest that the OMB and Isolation measures may be most sensitive to detecting many types of urban/rural tobacco-related disparities. Caveats and implications of these findings for rural tobacco use disparities research are discussed.

Research on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita shows some displaced residents returned to their disaster‐affected communities once the built environment was restored, new migrants settled in affected places as part of the rebuilding effort, and the regional migration system grew more urbanized and spatially concentrated during post‐disaster years. Research also shows that not all disaster‐affected places recovered their populations. Our study examines whether differential recovery is systematically patterned along the rural–urban gradient. Using U.S. Census Bureau estimates and IRS county‐to‐county migration data, we investigate whether the 2005 hurricane season differentially exacerbated or altered previous migration trends across a rural–urban gradient that incorporates proximity to metropolitan areas and disaster‐related housing loss. We find a rural–urban differential in Gulf Coast recovery migration: The disaster boosted migration among non‐metropolitan counties, yet these increases were smaller and short‐lived compared to the patterns found for metropolitan counties, most especially high loss metropolitan counties. Our findings encourage theories of environmental migration to incorporate spatial differentiation and scenarios of environmental changes to account for differential impacts on settlement patterns across the rural–urban continuum.",2019,2019-10-13,16,Katherine J.

This deliberate practice was outlawed in the 1960s and 1970s, but the correlation between neighborhood racial composition and home values persists. Using Census Bureau data from 1980 to 2015, the present study investigates the changing relationship between neighborhood racial composition and home appraisals, as well as the mechanisms that drive it. Contrary to what is often presumed, neighborhood racial composition was a stronger determinant of appraised values in 2015 than it was in 1980. Results suggest this is primarily due to contemporary appraising practices. Specifically, the use of the sales comparison approach has allowed historical racialized appraisals to influence contemporary values and appraisers’ racialized assumptions about neighborhoods to drive appraisal methods. These findings provide strong evidence that persistent racial inequality is driven in part by perpetual devaluing of communities of color and they suggest further regulation is required to foster equity.",2020,2020-06-12,115,Junia Howell; Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn,University of Pittsburgh,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Housing Market and Economics",Social Problems,06,"Howell, Junia; Korver‐Glenn, Elizabeth. 2020.

Though US Census racial and ethnic category decisions are not its main concern, Nilda Flores-González’s timely book Citizens But Not Americans offers crucial insight into how such a decision, if approved, would underscore Latino millennials’ sense of estrangement from their homeland by miscounting or misrepresenting them. By examining Latino millennials’ self-understandings of race and belonging, Flores-González contributes to ongoing debates concerning conceptual distinctions between race and ethnicity, the transformation of the US color line, and the ethnoracial dimensions of citizenship. To set the stage for these contributions, which emerged from a careful analysis of 97 in-depth interviews with second-, third-, and fourth-generation Latino millennials in the Chicago area, Flores-González first documents how this group experiences exclusion and discrimination in public spaces that continue to be racially segregated. While signals such as dark skin and Spanish language use subjected some youths to more intense experiences of discrimination, all youths experienced exclusion in public white spaces due to a shared Latin American ancestry that marked them as “not white.” These experiences contributed to youths’ self-understandings of their de jure inclusion but de facto exclusion from full participation in American life. The remainder of the book documents how these self-understandings were manifest in youths’ understandings of their ethnoracial identity, their “racial middle” position within the US racial hierarchy, and their strategies to recast themselves as “real” Americans.",2018,2018-02-13,0,Elizabeth Korver‐Glenn,,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Critical Race Theory in Education; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Social Forces,02,"Korver‐Glenn, Elizabeth. 2018.

The module collects data from over 300,000 firms on the use of five advanced technologies: AI, robotics, dedicated equipment, specialized software, and cloud computing. The adoption of these technologies remains low (especially for AI and robotics), varies substantially across industries, and concentrates on large and young firms. However, because larger firms are much more likely to adopt them, 12-64% of US workers and 22-72% of manufacturing workers are exposed to these technologies. Firms report a variety of motivations for adoption, including automating tasks previously performed by labor. Consistent with the use of these technologies for automation, adopters have higher labor productivity and lower labor shares. In particular, the use of these technologies is associated with a 11.4% higher labor productivity, which accounts for 20-30% of the difference in labor productivity between large firms and the median firm in an industry.

Most research in this area has been limited to specific crime types (e.g., sexual assault), or it has not taken into account possible changes in the characteristics of incidents associated with police notification. In this article, we advance knowledge about long‐term trends in the reporting of crime to the police by using data from the National Crime Survey (NCS) and the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and methods that take into account possible changes in the factors that affect reporting at the individual and incident level as well as changes in survey methodology. Using data from 1973 to 2005, our findings show that significant increases have occurred in the likelihood of police notification for sexual assault crimes as well as for other forms of assault and that these increases were observed for violence against women and violence against men, stranger and nonstranger violence, as well as crimes experienced by members of different racial and ethnic groups. The reporting of property victimization (i.e., motor vehicle theft, burglary, and larceny) also increased across time. Overall, observed increases in crime reporting account for about half of the divergence between the NCVS and the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) in the estimated magnitude of the 1990s crime decline—a result that highlights the need to corroborate findings about crime trends from multiple data sources.",2010,2010-02-01,227,Eric P.

This data-infrastructure limitation has hindered scientific understanding of whether immigrants are more or less likely than native-born Americans to be criminally victimized and how victimization may vary among immigrants of different statuses. We address these issues in the present study by using new data from the 2017-2018 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to explore the association between citizenship status and victimization risk in a nationally representative sample of households and persons aged 12 years and older. The research is guided by a theoretical framing that integrates insights from studies of citizenship with the literature on immigration and crime, as well as theories of victimization. We find that a person's foreign-born status (but not their acquired U.S. citizenship) confers protection against victimization. We also find that the protective benefit associated with being foreign-born does not extend to those with ambiguous citizenship status, who in our data exhibit attributes similar to the known characteristics of undocumented immigrants.

This issue is explored by comparing acquaintance robberies with the typical robbery involving strangers using NCVS data. The authors find that people who are Black, poor, young, and single are particularly vulnerable to acquaintance robbery.

We analyze cross-sectional data from the 2004–2016 General Social Survey and American Community Survey five-year estimates. Results from generalized ordered logit models suggest that support to immigration has been increasing over time. There is no difference by sex on attitudes toward immigration. Non-whites, those between 18 and 24 years of age, people with higher educational attainment, and non-Protestants are more likely to be pro-immigration. People working on sales, office, natural resources, construction, maintenance, production, transportation, material moving, and military occupations are less likely to support immigration. People living in the South Atlantic region are the least likely to support an increase in immigration. People who lived in areas at the age of 16 that tend to have higher proportions of foreign-born individuals are more likely to support immigration. People who self-classify as strong Democrats, Independents near Democrats, and in other parties are more likely to be in favor of an increase on the number of immigrants. People with more liberal political views are more likely to be in favor of immigration. People with lower levels of racial resentment have higher chances to be in favor of an increase in immigration.

They continue to grow in Texas without in-depth public understanding or explicit policy guidance on their role in the healthcare system. Our project aims to define socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of areas served by micro and regular hospitals, and by doing so assess micro hospitals’ impact in expanding healthcare access for disadvantaged populations in Texas.Methodology/Approach: We 1) estimated hospital service areas (catchment areas) with a spatial model based on advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) methods using a proprietary ESRI traffic network; 2) assigned population socioeconomic measures to the catchment areas from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, weighted with an empirically tested Gaussian distribution; 3) used two-tailed t-tests to compare means of population characteristics between micro and regular hospital catchment areas, and 4) conducted logistic regressions to examine relationships between selected population variables and the associated odds of micro hospital presence.Findings: We found micro hospitals in Texas tend to serve a population less stressed in healthcare access compared to those who are more in need as measured by various dimensions of disadvantages.Research Limitations/Implications: Our analysis takes a cross sectional look at the population characteristics of micro hospital service areas. Even though the initial geographic choices of micro hospitals may not reflect the long-term population changes in specific neighborhoods, our analysis can provide policy makers a tool to examine healthcare access for disadvantaged populations at given point in time. As the population socioeconomic characteristics have long been associated with healthcare inequality, we hope our analysis will help foster structural policy considerations that balance growing healthcare delivery innovations and their social accountability.Originality/Value of Paper: We used GIS based spatial modeling to dynamically capture the potential patient basis by travel time calculated with a street network dataset rather than using the traditional static census tract to define hospital service areas. By mapping these boundaries in space we illustrated patterns that regression alone might not. Most importantly, by integrating both spatial and nonspatial dimensions of healthcare access, we demonstrated that the policy considerations on the implications of equal opportunity for healthcare access need to take into account the social realities for those experiencing the most vulnerability in our society, rather than a conceptual “equality” existing in the spatial and market abstraction.",2022,2022-09-15,0,Jingqiu Ren; Ryan Earl; Ernesto F.

The authors examined the impact, by gender, of early- (before age 22) versus late-onset major depressive disorder on educational attainment. They also determined whether the efficacy and sustainability of antidepressant treatments and psychosocial outcomes vary by age at onset and quantified the impact of early- versus late-onset, as well as never-occurring, major depressive disorder on expected lifetime earnings.METHOD: The authors used logistic and multivariate regression methods to analyze data from a three-phase, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial that compared sertraline and imipramine treatment of 531 patients with chronic depression aged 30 years and older. These data were integrated with U.S. Census Bureau data on 1995 earnings by age, educational attainment, and gender.RESULTS: Early-onset major depressive disorder adversely affected the educational attainment of women but not of men. No significant difference in treatment responsiveness by age at onset was observed after 12 weeks of acute treatment or, for subjects rated as having responded, after 76 weeks of maintenance treatment. A randomly selected 21-year-old woman with early-onset major depressive disorder in 1995 could expect future annual earnings that were 12%–18% lower than those of a randomly selected 21-year-old woman whose onset of major depressive disorder occurred after age 21 or not at all.CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset major depressive disorder causes substantial human capital loss, particularly for women.

Using a transaction cost framework, we argue that ICT adoption influences foreign boundary decisions by lowering coordination costs both internally and externally for the firm. We propose that the heterogeneity in the technology’s characteristics, namely complexity and the production processes’ degree of codifiability, moderate this influence. Using a difference-in-differences methodology and exploiting the richness of confidential U.S. Census Bureau microdata, we find that overall ICT adoption is positively associated with greater likelihood of in-house production, as measured by increases in intra-firm trade shares. Furthermore, we find that more complex forms of ICT are associated with larger increases in intra-firm trade shares. Finally, our results indicate that MNEs in industries in which production specifications are more easily codified in an electronic format are less likely to engage in intra-firm relative to arms-length trade following ICT adoption.",2016,2016-01-01,3,Fariha Kamal; Wenjie Chen,Government of the United States of America; George Washington University,Firm Innovation and Growth; Corporate Finance and Governance; Global trade and economics,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Kamal, Fariha; Chen, Wenjie. 2016.

We call the measure Isolation and anticipate it will be useful as an alternative to commonly used rural classification schemes (e.g., the Census Bureau's measure). Following the best known standards for measuring rurality, it captures the trade-off between access to resource-rich, high-population-density areas and the cost of travel to those areas; thus even intrinsically low-resource areas may have high access to nearby resources. Validity was tested with proxies such as nighttime outdoor lights, distance to hospitals, physician availability, and access to high quality food. The Isolation scale demonstrated good construct validity (i.e., both convergent and criterion validity). Fit statistics indicated that, compared to other commonly-used urban/rural definitions, the Isolation scale was the best overall measure when predicting several proxies for rurality, even when categorized. We also show that the measure does a substantially better job at explaining national health outcome data at the state level. This new continuous Isolation scale shows considerable promise for improving our conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of the features of rurality that are pertinent to rural health disparities research, and can also be useful to policy makers who may find value in using isolation thresholds that are most relevant to their policy planning needs.",2017,2017-12-21,4,Nathan Doogan; Megan E.

Specifically, we measure the price premium that law firms pay to locate in CBDs. Using micro-level data from the 1992 and 2007 Census of Services, we find that after controlling for firm size, firm specialization characteristics, and MSA and county attributes, law firms within CBDs pay about 15 to 20 percent more in overhead compared to those firms outside CBDs – a result consistent across time between 1992 and 2007. When including an important additional measure of firm quality, however, we find that this impact is reduced to about 7 to 9 percent, but still statistically significant. Additional results show that there is a significant correlation between firm quality and CBD location. We also find that firm size and firm specialization measures are important factors in the choice to locate within CBDs.

With these data, we assess how a contractor's position on the subcontracting chain and other establishment characteristics are associated with the number and likelihood of injuries on the job. Findings indicate that as work flows down subcontracting chains, that work is associated with higher rates of injury. Up-chain contractors can choose what scope of work they will keep on a project and what they will offload.

Research was conducted at the US Bureau of the Census; disclosure of the MECS/LRD data used as a basis for this report was subject to the Bureau`s confidentiality restriction. The project is designed to examine the plant-level energy behavior of energy-intensive industries. In Phase 1, six industries at the four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC) level were studied. The utility of analyzing four-digit SIC samples at the plant level is mixed, but the plant-level structure of the MECS/LRD makes analyzing samples disaggregated below the four-digit level feasible, particularly when the MECS/LRD data are combined with trade association or other external data. When external data are used, the validity of using value of shipments as a measure of output for analyzing energy use can also be examined. Phase 1 results indicate that technical efficiency and the distribution of energy intensities vary significantly at the plant level. They also show that the six industries exhibit monopsony-like behavior; that is, energy prices vary significantly at the plant level, with lower prices being correlated with a higher level of energy consumption. Finally, they show to what degree selected energy-intensive products are manufactured outside their primary industry.",1992,1992-08-01,6,Gale Boyd; M.J.

While the vast majority (90%) of different-sex couples were married, we report a more even split in cohabitation and marriage among same-sex couples. Our evaluation of sociodemographic characteristics of married and cohabiting couples indicates that differences were less prominent among same-sex couples than among different-sex couples, suggesting weaker sociodemographic selection into marriage among the former.

Using pre‐ and post‐migration earnings and their earnings in the US from the American Community Survey (ACS), we characterise the selection of migrants on observable and non‐observable characteristics. Merging the data with US ACS data, we can also measure the expected earnings premium of migration to the US and the earnings premium for those that returned to Mexico. We find that migrants respond to the expected earnings premium to migration, once we control for migration costs. Also, the structure of the premium across skill groups generates negative selection on average and it can explain selection on observable and unobservables. We also find that returnees are more positively selected over skills than migrants to the US. Initial poverty, old age and family ties are strong deterrents of migration to the US, once we account for the skill‐specific migration premium. We also find a strong under‐representation of college educated among migrants to the US, possibly a consequence of the fact that undocumented migration is not an attractive option for those individuals.",2012,2012-02-01,76,J.

One issue that has become lost in the current discussion is how firms respond to import competition and how these responses, in turn, are transmitted to the labor market. In previous work, we have argued that outsourcing, by which we mean the import of intermediate inputs by domestic firms, has contributed to an increase in the relative demand for skilled labor in the United States. If firms respond to import competition from low-wage countries by moving non- skill-intensive activities abroad, then trade will shift employment towards skilled workers within industries. In this paper, we extend our previous work by combining new import data from the revised NBER trade database with disaggregated data on input purchases from the Census of Manufactures. We construct industry-by-industry estimates of outsourcing for the period 1972-1990 and reexamine whether outsourcing has contributed to an increase in relative demand for skilled labor. Our main finding is that outsourcing can account for 31-51% of the increase in the relative demand for skilled labor that occurred in U.S. manufacturing industries during the 1980s, compared to our previous estimate of 15-33%.",1996,1996-01-01,1538,Robert C.

Review and Perspectives for New Research,"We review the literature on the sources of financing and associated financing frictions facing small firms. Using data from the Survey of Business Owners, we first show that about half of small firms do not report using any external finance either for startup or for expansion. Among those that do, bank and credit card-based borrowing by the business and its owners account for the overwhelming share of external finance. Second, we highlight that there is growing evidence of heterogeneity in financing frictions facing small firms: a substantial share of firms may not even seek external finance or benefit from relaxed constraints because they do not wish to grow; on the other hand, relaxing constraints has large measured effects on investment and employment for certain sub-populations of small firms. This heterogeneity has important implications for how average effects are interpreted in academic studies, as well as for how policy is enacted. We conclude by noting the greater availability of micro data on small firm financing in recent years. This has the potential to generate substantial insight on the degree to which the rise of financial technology can overcome traditional financing frictions, as well as enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of different types of government interventions on small business financing and growth.",2022,2022-01-01,1,Ramana Nanda; Gordon Phillips,Entrepreneurial Ecosystems; Harvard University; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Corporate Finance and Governance; Private Equity and Venture Capital; FinTech, Crowdfunding, Digital Finance",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Nanda, Ramana; Phillips, Gordon. 2022.

However, the empirical literature documenting such effects has been limited. This study documents the long-term effects of in utero exposure to air lead on adult socio-economic outcomes, including real earnings, disabilities, employment, public assistance, and education, using US survey and administrative data. Specifically, we match individuals in the 2000 US Decennial Census and 2001–2014 American Community Surveys to average lead concentrations in the individual’s birth county during his/her 9 months in utero . We then estimate the effects of shocks to airborne lead conditional on observable characteristics, county fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and month-year fixed effects. We find a 0.5 μg/m 3 decrease in air lead, representing the average 1975–85 change resulting from the passage of the U.S. Clean Air Act, is associated with an increase in earnings of 3.5%, or a present value, at birth, of $21,400 in lifetime earnings. Decomposing this effect, we find greater exposure to lead in utero is associated with an increase in disabilities in adulthood, an increase in receiving public assistance, and a decrease in employment. Looking at effects by sex, long-term effects for girls seem to fall on participation in the formal labor market, whereas for boys it appears to fall more on hours worked. This is the first study to document such long-term effects from lead using US data. We estimate the present value in 2020, from all earnings impacts from 1975 forward, to be $4.23 Trillion using a discount rate of 3%. In 2020 alone, the benefits are $252 B, or about 1.2% of GDP. Thus, our estimates imply the Clean Air Act’s lead phase out is still returning a national dividend of over 1% every year.",2023,2023-11-22,4,H.

Using data from the American Community Survey, we find that exposure to casualties at a young age (17-18) increases the probability of dropping out from high school, and decreases the probability of attaining a college degree.

First, we propose two new residual diagnostic tests of the assumption that mobility is exogenous to unmodeled determinants of earnings. Both tests reject exogenous mobility. We relax exogenous mobility by modeling the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent-type framework. Our results suggest that allowing endogenous mobility increases the variation in earnings explained by individual heterogeneity and reduces the proportion due to employer and match effects. To assess external validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker. The mobility-bias-corrected estimates attribute much more of the variation in revenue per worker to variation in match quality and worker quality than the uncorrected estimates.

The coordination friction model places restrictions on the joint distribution of worker and firm effects from a linear decomposition of log labor earnings. These restrictions permit estimation of the unobservable ability and productivity differences between workers and their employers as well as the way workers sort into jobs on the basis of these unobservable factors. The estimation is performed on matched employer-employee data from the LEHD program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimated correlation between worker and firm effects from the earnings decomposition is close to zero, a finding that is often interpreted as evidence that there is no sorting by comparative advantage in the labor market. Our estimates suggest that this finding actually results from a lack of sufficient heterogeneity in the workforce and available jobs.

We relax the exogenous mobility assumptions by modeling the evolution of the matched data as an evolving bipartite graph using a Bayesian latent class framework. Our results suggest that endogenous mobility biases estimated firm effects toward zero. To assess validity, we match our estimates of the wage components to out-of-sample estimates of revenue per worker.

Abowd is the Chief Scientist and Associate Director for Research and Methodology, US Census Bureau. He completed his AB in Economics at Notre Dame in 1973 and his PhD in Economics at University of Chicago in 1977 under Arnold Zellner. During his academic career, John has held faculty positions at Princeton, the University of Chicago, and, since 1987 at Cornell University where he is the Edmund Ezra Day Professor Emeritus of Economics, Statistics and Data Science. John was trained as a statistician and labor economist, and his economic research has focused on the rigorous empirical evaluation of labor market institutions. In the late 1990s, he began working with the Census Bureau on projects that would end up leveraging administrative and survey records into official statistical products. Through that work, he has developed a research agenda focused on issues necessary to generate those products, including data privacy, synthetic data, total error analysis, data linkage, and missing data problems, among others.",2022,2022-02-20,1,Ian M.

Our purpose was to gather experts from various backgrounds together to continue discussing the development of formal privacy systems for Census Bureau data products. This workshop was a successor to a previous workshop held in October 2016 (Vilhuber & Schmutte 2017). At our prior workshop, we hosted computer scientists, survey statisticians, and economists, all of whom were experts in data privacy. At that time we discussed the practical implementation of cutting-edge methods for publishing data with formal, provable privacy guarantees, with a focus on applications to Census Bureau data products. The teams developing those applications were just starting out when our first workshop took place, and we spent our time brainstorming solutions to the various problems researchers were encountering, or anticipated encountering. For these cutting-edge formal privacy models, there had been very little effort in the academic literature to apply those methods in real-world settings with large, messy data. We therefore brought together an expanded group of specialists from academia and government who could shed light on technical challenges, subject matter challenges and address how data users might react to changes in data availability and publishing standards.In May 2017, we organized a follow-up workshop, which these proceedings report on. We reviewed progress made in four different areas. The four topics discussed as part of the workshop were 1. the 2020 Decennial Census; 2. the American Community Survey (ACS); 3. the 2017 Economic Census; 4. measuring the demand for privacy and for data quality.As in our earlier workshop, our goals were to 1. Discuss the specific challenges that have arisen in ongoing efforts to apply formal privacy models to Census data products by drawing together expertise of academic and governmental researchers; 2. Produce short written memos that summarize concrete suggestions for practical applications to specific Census Bureau priority areas.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Lars Vilhuber; Ian M.

A one-percent increase in the portion of county area expenditures contributed to parks and recreation operations was associated with decreased relative risk of very good (RRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.96), good (RRR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.97), or fair (RRR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.87, 0.92) health relative to excellent health.

However, government funding for parks and recreation is highly susceptible to the ebbs and flows of the national economy. Given this, the purpose of this study was to test the relationship between county area spending on parks and recreation operations and all-cause mortality in the United States from the years 1980-2010. Using data from 1980 to 2010 collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, we analyzed the relationship between per capita county area spending on parks and recreation and county-level all-cause age-standardized female, male, and overall mortality using county and year fixed effects as well as relevant time-variant controls. The study was conducted during 2017 and 2018. County area spending on parks and recreation was negatively associated with overall and female-specific mortality from 1980 to 2010. According to our models for female and overall all-cause age-standardized mortality, when holding all else equal, a hundred-dollar increase in 2010 dollars in per capita parks and recreation operational expenditures was associated with an average decrease in morality of 3.9 and 3.4 deaths per 100,000, respectively. Although not commonly viewed as a form of healthcare spending, increased government funding for parks and recreation services had a significant association with decreased county level mortality. Our results suggest higher levels of per capita spending on parks and recreation may lead to lower levels of mortality.",2019,2019-02-10,13,J. Tom Mueller; So Young Park; Andrew J.

Scholars have found that estimates generated via Census-released test data are accurate for aggregate total population statistics of larger spatial units (e.g. counties), but introduce considerable discrepancies for estimates of subgroups. At present, the ramifications of this new approach remain unclear for rural populations. In this brief, we focus on rural populations and evaluate the ability of the finalized differential privacy algorithm to provide accurate population counts and growth rates from 2000 to 2010 across the rural-urban continuum for the total, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino/a, and non-Hispanic American Indian population. We find the method introduces significant discrepancies relative to the prior approach into counts and growth rate estimates at the county level for all groups except the total and non-Hispanic white population. Further, discrepancies increase dramatically as we move from urban to rural. Thus, the differential privacy method likely introduced significant discrepancies for rural and non-white populations into 2020 census tabulations.",2021,2021-06-03,2,J. Tom Mueller; Alexis R.

However, the SPM still faces several critiques from scholars focused on poverty of non-metropolitan areas. Key among these critiques is the geographic adjustment for cost of living employed in the SPM, which is based solely upon median rental costs and pools together all non-metropolitan counties within each state. Here, we evaluate the current geographic adjustment of the SPM using both microdata and aggregate data from the American Community Survey for 2014-2018. By comparing housing costs, tenure, and commuting, we determine median rent is likely an appropriate basis for geographic adjustment. However, by demonstrating the wide variability between median rents of non-metropolitan counties within the same state, we show that the current operationalization of this geographic adjustment is sorely lacking.",2021,2021-05-26,2,J.

A multi-scalar analysis of distributional justice and wind energy in the United States,"The transition towards renewable energy is likely to be uneven across social and spatial dimensions. To ensure this transition is equitable and just, energy injustice has become the key framework for analyzing and interpreting the distribution of energy infrastructure. Wind energy development has experienced a significant gap between broad public support for increased development but persistent localized opposition to proposed projects, indicating that wind represents a locally unwanted land use. We argue that although the negative impacts of wind energy infrastructure are less extreme than those posed by other, more toxic, unwanted land uses, their status as a locally unwanted land use will produce similar distributional injustices as have been found throughout the environmental injustice literature. Using data from both the American Community Survey and the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, we use logistic and Poisson regressions, fixed effects, and temporal lags to evaluate the current landscape of wind energy injustice along the social dimensions of income, race and ethnicity, age, education, labor force participation, and rurality at three spatial scales: between all counties within the contiguous United States, between counties within states with wind energy, and between census tracts within counties with wind energy. We find results vary by scale and whether the model is comparing the presence of any development or the size of that development. The most evidence of injustice is visible at the within-county level related to whether or not there is any wind energy development, with few relationships present when evaluating the absolute size of development.",2019,2019-01-11,1,J.

Finally, the estimated magnitude of misreporting, especially among longer-term Mexican-born men, is sensitive to assumptions about the rate of emigration in our administrative-based demographic estimates, and assumptions about coverage error in the ACS, though altering these assumptions does not change the conclusions drawn from the general patterns of the results.For applications that use citizenship as an indicator of legal status, we recommend that self-reported data on citizenship be accepted at face value for all groups except those with less than five years of U.S. residence and Mexican men.",2013,2013-07-02,31,Jennifer Van Hook; James D.

We study this relationship by using two sets of estimates for the 2014 undocumented foreign-born population in U.S. metropolitan areas acquired from the Pew Research Center and the Migration Population Institute, 2013-2015 FBI Uniform Crime Report data, and 2011-2015 American Community Survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau, to model the association between undocumented immigration and violent and property crime. Findings are consistent across all estimates of metropolitan undocumented populations. Net of relevant covariates, we find negative effects of undocumented immigration on the overall property crime rate, larceny, and burglary; effects in models using violent crime measures as the outcomes are statistically non-significant.

Researchers use demographic methods to generate aggregated information about the number and demographic composition of the unauthorized immigrant population. But understanding their social and economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, occupations) often requires identifying likely unauthorized immigrants at the individual level. We describe a new method that pools data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which identifies unauthorized immigrants, with data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which does not. This method treats unauthorized status as missing data to be imputed by multiple imputation techniques. Likely unauthorized immigrants in the ACS are identified based on similarities to self-reported unauthorized immigrants in the SIPP.

We draw on existing theory and research in order to derive a theoretical account of state-level historical mechanisms that are likely to lead to varying patterns of racial identification within the two states and a set of propositions predicting the nature of this variation. Results indicate that the Mexican-origin population in Texas is substantially more likely to claim White racial identification than their counterparts in California, even after accounting for factors related to racial identity formation. Further analysis indicates that this result is robust and buffets the notion that the historical development of the racial context in Texas has engendered a present-day context in which “Whiteness” carries a distinctive social value, relative to California’s ethnoracial context, and that this social value is reflected in the ways in which individuals of Mexican origin respond to race questions on U.S. Census surveys.",2020,2020-01-01,1,Jorge Ballinas; James D.

However, analyses of geographic disparities in mortality outcomes focus almost exclusively on contemporaneously measured geographic place (e.g., state of residence at death), thereby potentially conflating the role of early-life conditions, migration patterns, and effects of destinations. We employ the newly available Mortality Disparities in American Communities data set, which links respondents in the 2008 American Community Survey to official death records, and estimate consequential differences based on the method of aggregation we use: the unweighted mean absolute deviation of the difference in life expectancy at age 50 measured by state of birth versus state of residence is 0.58 years for men and 0.40 years for women. These differences are also spatially clustered, and we show that regional inequality in life expectancy is higher based on life expectancies by state of birth, implying that interstate migration mitigates baseline geographic inequality in mortality outcomes. Finally, we assess how state-specific features of in-migration, out-migration, and nonmigration together shape measures of mortality disparities by state (of residence), further demonstrating the difficulty of clearly interpreting these widely used measures.",2023,2023-03-13,7,Jason M.

Previous studies have linked early life individual and family factors, along with various contemporaneous place-based exposures to differential individual CVD mortality risk. However, the impacts of early life place exposures and how they compare to the effects of an individual's current place of residence on CVD mortality risk is not well understood. Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, this research examined the effects of both state of birth and state of residence on individual's risk of CVD mortality. We estimated individual mortality risk by estimating multi-level logistic regression models. We found that during a follow-up period of 11 years, 18,292 (4.2%) out of 433,345 participants died from CVD. The impact of state of birth on subsequent CVD mortality risk are greater than state of residence, even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Individuals who were born in certain states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania on average had higher CVD mortality risk. Conversely, those born in California, North Dakota, and Montana were found to have lower risk, no matter where they presently live. This study implies that early life state-level environments may be more prominent to individual's CVD mortality risk, compared to the state in which one lives. Future research should address specific mechanisms through which state of birth may affect people's risk of CVD mortality.",2021,2021-07-16,8,Wei Xu; Michael Topping; Jason M.

While the results on socioeconomic outcomes mimic those in the literature, showing reductions in completed schooling and income fifty years following influenza exposure, the findings also suggest no effect on overall mortality or by categories of cause-of-death.

The aim of this study is to assess and compare the importance of state of birth and state of residence in predicting mortality for adults over age 50 in the US. Using nationally representative data of nearly 100,000 adults over age 50 from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, we estimated individual mortality risk using multi-level logistic regression with state of birth and state of residence as second-level random effects. We assessed whether state of residence and state of birth contributed to the variation in adult mortality. We also decomposed state-of-residence random effects to compare ""movers"" and ""stayers."" Our results indicate that state of birth is a stronger predictor of age-, race/ethnicity- and sex-adjusted mortality in the US than state of residence at the time of death. The adult mortality profiles of many states are substantially impacted by the composition of ""movers."" Failing to account for residential mobility has clouded our understanding of the patterns and causes of geographic differences in adult mortality.

This paper draws from the 1960 US Decennial Census to examine whether exposed individuals had different family formation patterns than adjacent unexposed cohorts. The findings suggest small overall effects on marriage rates, number of children, and several measures of “type” of spouse for men, but moderate effects for women. The findings also show that exposed individuals have spouses with lower schooling than unexposed counterparts, this effect is particularly large for women, and it increases the likelihood of marrying spouses with very low levels of schooling.",2017,2017-05-15,1,Jason M.

The Study of the Epidemiology of Pediatric Hypertension (SUPERHERO) is a multisite retrospective Registry of youth evaluated by subspecialists for hypertension disorders. Sites obtain harmonized electronic health record data using standardized biomedical informatics scripts validated with randomized manual record review. Inclusion criteria are index visit for International Classification of Diseases Diagnostic Codes, 10th Revision (ICD-10 code)-defined hypertension disorder ≥January 1, 2015 and age &amp;lt;19 years. We exclude patients with ICD-10 code-defined pregnancy, kidney failure on dialysis, or kidney transplantation. Data include demographics, anthropomorphics, U.S. Census Bureau tract, histories, blood pressure, ICD-10 codes, medications, laboratory and imaging results, and ambulatory blood pressure. SUPERHERO leverages expertise in epidemiology, statistics, clinical care, and biomedical informatics to create the largest and most diverse registry of youth with newly diagnosed hypertension disorders.

Small vs. Large vs. Young,"There's been a long, sometimes heated, debate on the role of firm size in employment growth. Despite skepticism in the academic community, the notion that growth is negatively related to firm size remains appealing to policymakers and small business advocates. The widespread and repeated claim from this community is that most new jobs are created by small businesses. Using data from the Census Bureau Business Dynamics Statistics and Longitudinal Business Database, we explore the many issues regarding the role of firm size and growth that have been at the core of this ongoing debate (such as the role of regression to the mean). We find that the relationship between firm size and employment growth is sensitive to these issues. However, our main finding is that once we control for firm age there is no systematic relationship between firm size and growth. Our findings highlight the important role of business startups and young businesses in U.S. job creation. Business startups contribute substantially to both gross and net job creation. In addition, we find an ""up or out"" dynamic of young firms.

The triangulated database allows us to maximize match rates and provide validation for a large fraction of matches. In this paper, we describe the construction of the database and explore basic features of the data. We find patenting firms, particularly young patenting firms, disproportionally contribute jobs to the U.S. economy. We find that patenting is a relatively rare event among small firms but that most patenting firms are nevertheless small, and that patenting is not as rare an event for the youngest firms compared to the oldest firms. Although manufacturing firms are more likely to patent than firms in other sectors, we find that most patenting firms are in the services and wholesale sectors.

Startups create jobs and power economic growth. That's an article of faith in the United States—but, as The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship reveals, our faith may be built on shaky ground. Economists Robert Fairlie, Zachary Kroff, Javier Miranda, and Nikolas Zolas—working with Census Bureau microdata—have developed a new data set, the Comprehensive Startup Panel, that tracks job creation and the survival of every startup in the country. In doing so, they recalibrate our understanding of how startups behave in the US economy. Specifically, their work seeks to answer three critical questions: How many jobs does each entrepreneur create? Do those jobs disappear quickly? And how long do entrepreneurial enterprises survive? Job creation and survival rates are, the authors conclude, much lower than those reported by official federal sources. Such discrepancies emerge from the more comprehensive picture drawn from this new data set—a picture that, for instance, highlights the important but understudied differences between employer firms (startups that hire people) and nonemployer firms (startups that do not initially hire people but may do so in later years as they grow). This reframing captures the vast number of businesses that start with no employees, a number largely missing from the statistics underpinning the mythos of the riskiness of entrepreneurship. The book also explores who owns startups—focusing on differences by race and ethnicity. With its new, wider view of the realities of job creation and survival among startups, The Promise and Peril of Entrepreneurship has significant implications for economic policymaking and research, and for the billions of dollars that the government and the private sector invest in promoting entrepreneurship.",2023,2023-06-29,6,Robert W.

As a results, national statistical offices (NSOs) rarely release establishment or firm-level business microdata due to the risk to respondent confidentiality. One potential approach for overcoming these risks is to release synthetic data where the establishment data are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the distributions of the real underlying microdata. The US Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies in collaboration with Duke University, the National Institute of Statistical Sciences, and Cornell University made available a synthetic public use file for the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) comprising more than 20 million records for all business establishment with paid employees dating back to 1976. The resulting product, dubbed the SynLBD, was released in 2010 and is the first-ever comprehensive business microdata set publicly released in the United States including data on establishments' employment and payroll, birth and death years, and industrial classification.

If owner‐stated values are accurate, the AHS (as well as other survey instruments) can be used by researchers studying a variety of topics. In this study we use the metropolitan version of the AHS for three cities over fourteen years to compare owners' valuations with sales prices of houses that sold in the twelve months prior to an interview. We find that, on average, recent buyers report house values that are 8.4% higher than the stated sales prices. Further analysis indicates that these recent buyers, when compared with owners with longer tenure, overvalue their houses by 3.3%, on average. Thus, we find that the average owner overvalues his house by 5.1%. Also, differences between sales prices and owners' valuations are not related to particular characteristics of the house, occupants (other than length of tenure), or neighborhood. Thus, the use of the owners' valuations will result in accurate estimates of house price indexes and will provide reliable estimates of the prices of house and neighborhood characteristics.",1999,1999-06-01,215,Katherine A.

We exploit special features of the national sample of the American Housing Survey and properties of housing markets that allow us to create ‘natural’ instruments and therefore identify the impact of social interactions. We find evidence of both endogenous and contextual neighbourhood effects. We report two alternative sets of estimates for neighbourhood effects that differ in terms of the instruments we use for estimating the model. When the endogenous neighbourhood effect is large the respective contextual effects are weak, and vice versa . The elasticity of housing demand with respect to the mean of the neighbours' housing demands (the endogenous effect) ranges from 0.19 to 0.66 and is generally very significant. The contextual effects are also very significant. A key such effect, the elasticity with respect to the mean of neighbours' permanent incomes, ranges from 0.17 to 0.54.

Smaller minimum wage increases, as well as increases linked to inflation indexation provisions, appear to have had much smaller (and possibly positive) effects on employment over our sample period. The estimates thus raise the potential importance of nonlinearities in the minimum wage's effects, which are consistent with standard models of the labor market.

Drawing on Census and American Community Survey data from 1990 to 2010, we first explore whether changes in racial/ethnic composition occur alongside ascent. We find that, while most neighborhoods’ racial/ethnic composition does not dramatically change during this period, neighborhoods that experienced ascent are much more likely to transition from majority-minority to mixed race or predominantly White than nonascending neighborhoods. Then, we use microdata to analyze whether two potential drivers of ascent, the in-migration of higher-socioeconomic status (SES) households and changes in the fortunes of long-term residents, are racially/ethnically stratified. We argue that the process of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent perpetuates neighborhood racial/ethnic hierarchy. While most Black and Hispanic neighborhoods remain majority-minority, those that ascend are more likely to experience a succession of high-SES White residents replacing minority residents.",2018,2018-04-19,32,Ann Marie Deer Owens; Jennifer Candipan,University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Homelessness and Social Issues; Migration and Labor Dynamics",Urban Affairs Review,04,"Owens, Ann Marie Deer; Candipan, Jennifer. 2018.

Segregation and Diversity of Young Adult Neighborhoods,"As young adults, the Millennial generation arrived as the largest and most racially and ethnically diverse generation in U.S. history. These unique demographic characteristics, along with more progressive self-reported views on racial and ethnic issues, have prompted some to label this generation as a demographic bridge to America’s diverse future. This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether Millennial young adult neighborhoods are more racially and ethnically diverse and located in less segregated metropolitan areas than the young adult neighborhoods of prior generations. Using 1990-2019 Census and American Community Survey data, we find a mixed story. On the one hand, young adult White Early Millennials were living in neighborhoods with similar or slightly higher diversity levels, and metropolitan areas with similar or slightly lower segregation levels compared to White young adults in prior generations. On the other hand, young adult White Late Millennials tend to live in more segregated neighborhoods, and in most cases, their segregation levels surpass those for White young adult Gen Xers. These mixed findings provide moderate support for the perspective that the Millennial generation is a bridge to diversity, albeit not the final destination.

Using data from the 2008–2010 American Community Survey and 1998–2010 Integrated Health Interview Series, we demonstrate how naturalization, a key indicator of social and political inclusion, is related to functional health in midlife and older age. Consistent with the theoretical framework, we find that among those foreign-born who immigrated as children and young adults, naturalized citizens show better health at older ages compared with noncitizens, although this relationship is partly mediated by education. But among those older foreign-born who immigrated at middle and older ages, naturalized citizens report worse health compared with noncitizens.

Over the last decade, residual estimates have typically fallen within a narrow range of 10.5 to 12 million. Yet it remains unclear how sensitive residual estimates are to their underlying assumptions. We examine the extent to which estimates may plausibly vary owing to uncertainties in their underlying assumptions about coverage error, emigration, and mortality. Findings show that most of the range in residual estimates derives from uncertainty about emigration rates among legal permanent residents, naturalized citizens, and humanitarian entrants (LNH); estimates are less sensitive to assumptions about mortality among the LNH foreign-born and coverage error for the unauthorized and LNH populations in U.S. Census Bureau surveys. Nevertheless, uncertainty in all three assumptions contributes to a range of estimates, whereby there is a 50% chance that the unauthorized foreign-born population falls between 9.1 and 12.2 million and a 95% chance that it falls between 7.0 and 15.7 million.",2021,2021-09-27,13,Jennifer Van Hook; Anne Morse; Randy Capps; Julia Gelatt,Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University; Migration Policy Institute; Migration Policy Institute,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Demography,09,"Hook, Jennifer Van; Morse, Anne; Capps, Randy; Gelatt, Julia. 2021.

Using a series of residual estimates based on 2000 Census and 2001–2022 American Community Survey (ACS), I estimate the components of change for the unauthorized immigrant population from 2000 to 2022 by region and country of origin. Further, I develop and present novel measures of expected duration in unauthorized status and demographic impact of unauthorized entries (i.e., person‐years lived in unauthorized status). Results reveal dramatic changes over the last two decades. In the early 2000s, the unauthorized immigrant population was dominated by Mexicans who tended to remain in the United States for extended periods of time and whose demographic impact on the US population was substantial. After the 2007–2008 Great Recession, a new pattern emerged. Unauthorized migrants now arrive from across the globe, including Central America and Asia (up through 2018), and most recently from Europe, Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and other parts of South America. These new unauthorized immigrants are more likely to arrive on temporary nonimmigrant visas (which typically allow a foreigner to live and work in the United States for six years) and, with the exception of Venezuelans, spend less time in unauthorized status.

This structure allows the model to capture dependence among units in the same group. It also facilitates simultaneous modeling of variables at both group and unit levels.

Researchers have developed a variety of default routines to implement multiple imputation; however, there has been limited research comparing the performance of these methods, particularly for categorical data. We use simulation studies to compare repeated sampling properties of three default multiple imputation methods for categorical data, including chained equations using generalized linear models, chained equations using classification and regression trees, and a fully Bayesian joint distribution based on Dirichlet Process mixture models. We base the simulations on categorical data from the American Community Survey. In the circumstances of this study, the results suggest that default chained equations approaches based on generalized linear models are dominated by the default regression tree and Bayesian mixture model approaches.

Given just the data, it can be difficult to determine the extent and distribution of this error process and, hence, to obtain accurate inferences that involve the error-prone variables. In some settings, however, analysts have access to a data source on different individuals with high-quality measurements of the error-prone survey items. We present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve inferences in the error-prone survey. The basic idea is to posit models about the rates at which individuals make errors, coupled with models for the values reported when errors are made. This can avoid the unrealistic assumption of conditional independence typically used in data fusion.

We present a data fusion framework for leveraging this information to improve inferences in the error-prone survey.

For example, ill-intentioned individuals might link data subjects to records in other databases by matching on common characteristics (keys). Successful links are particularly problematic for data subjects with combinations of keys that are unique in the population. Hence, as part of their assessments of disclosure risks, many data stewards estimate the probabilities that sample uniques on sets of discrete keys are also population uniques on those keys. This is typically done using log-linear modeling on the keys. However, log-linear models can yield biased estimates of cell probabilities for sparse contingency tables with many zero counts, which often occurs in databases with many keys. This bias can result in unreliable estimates of probabilities of uniqueness and, hence, misrepresentations of disclosure risks. We propose an alternative to log-linear models for datasets with sparse keys based on a Bayesian version of grade of membership (GoM) models. We present a Bayesian GoM model for multinomial variables and offer a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting the model. We evaluate the approach by treating data from a recent U.S. Census Bureau public use microdata sample as a population, taking simple random samples from that population, and benchmarking estimated probabilities of uniqueness against population values. Compared to log-linear models, GoM models provide more accurate estimates of the total number of uniques in the samples. Additionally, they offer record-level predictions of uniqueness that dominate those based on log-linear models.

At first glance, safely sharing confidential data seems a straightforward task: simply strip unique identifiers such as names, addresses, and identification numbers before releasing the data. However, these actions alone may not suffice when other identifying variables, such as geographic or demographic data, remain in the file. These quasi-identifiers can be used to match units in the released data to other databases. For example, Sweeney4 showed that 97% of the records in publicly available voter registration lists for Cambridge, MA, could be uniquely identified using birth date and 9-digit zip code. By matching the information in these lists, she was able to identify Massachusetts Governor William Weld in an anonymized medical database. As the amount of information readily available to the public continues to expand (eg, via the Internet and private companies), investigators releasing large-scale epidemiologic data run the risk of similar breaches. In this commentary, we present a primer on techniques for sharing confidential data. We classify techniques into 2 broad classes: restricted access, in which access is provided only to trusted users, and restricted data, in which the original data are somehow altered before sharing. Restricted-access Strategies Sharing unaltered confidential data with external researchers, while preserving confidentiality, is referred to as restricted-access methods. If one or more researchers have been trusted to analyze confidential data, it seems logical that they should be able to share the data with additional trusted researchers. However, researchers may be prevented by law or by the policies of their institution or sponsoring agency from sharing the data, even with their colleagues. Without procedures and rules for sharing data, there is little an individual researcher can do. There are 2 primary restricted-access methods employed by most data stewards, including government agencies and individual investigators: licensing agreements and restricted-data centers.5 Under the licensing model, researchers with legitimate research questions that can be answered with the confidential data enter into an agreement with the data steward and are provided with a copy of the data for use at their home institution. Typically, agreements specify how the data should be protected, and may require certification of destruction at project completion. Fees may be charged to cover data processing and administrative costs. In some cases, such as licensing agreements with the National Center for Education Statistics, the data are slightly altered to introduce a small amount of uncertainty, but not enough to concern analysts. In the data-center model, researchers must carry out their research in a physically and electronically secure facility controlled by the data steward. Researchers are often required to submit a proposal describing the research plans, the confidential data needed, and in some cases how their research will benefit the data steward. In additional to travel expenses, researchers may be required to pay substantial fees to access the data center, and they cannot remove any output without approval from the data steward. The US Census Bureau and National Center for Health Statistics provide researchers access to confidential data in this manner. An alternative is a secure online data center, such as the National Opinion Research Centers Virtual Data Enclave. Confidential data are stored on secure servers that approved researchers can access through remote login from prespecified IP addresses. The researcher can see and analyze the actual data, but the server disables local saving, printing of the data and analysis results, and cut-and-paste operations. As with a physical data enclave, analysis results are checked for potential disclosure violations by Center staff before being approved for publication outside the enclave. The virtual enclave has advantages over licensing models, in that the risks of breaches are centrally managed, for example, there are no misplaced CD ROMs or unapproved file sharing. A variant on the virtual data enclave is the remote analysis server. This is a query-based system that provides the results of analyses of confidential data without actually allowing users to see the confidential values, thus reducing disclosure risks.6–8 Examples include the US Census Bureau's American FactFinder, which is available to anyone but produces only tabular summaries, or the Australian Remote Access Data Laboratory, which restricts users but allows more flexible analyses. Other query-based methods under research include verification servers,9 which provide users with feedback on the quality of analyses based on redacted public use data, and output perturbation through differential privacy,10 whereby noise is added to query results, so that they do not provide information about any individual with certainty. Restricted-data Strategies Although restricted-access policies use trust and physical protection, restricted-data policies provide unfettered access to data that have been modified before release. The key issue for data stewards is determining how much alteration is needed to ensure protection without completely destroying the usefulness of the data. To make informed decisions about this trade-off, data stewards can quantify disclosure risk and data usefulness associated with particular release strategies. For example, when 2 competing policies result in approximately the same disclosure risk, the one with higher data usefulness should be selected. Quantifiable metrics can help data stewards decide when the risks are sufficiently low, and the usefulness is adequately high, to justify releasing the altered data.11,12 The literature on disclosure risk assessment highlights 2 main types of disclosures, namely (i) identification disclosures, which occur when an ill-intentioned user of the data (henceforth called an intruder) correctly identifies individual records in the released data, and (ii) attribute disclosures, which occur when an intruder learns the values of sensitive variables for individual records in the data. Attribute disclosures usually are preceded by identity disclosures—for example, when original values of attributes are released, intruders who correctly identify records learn the attribute values—so that focus typically is on identification-disclosure risk assessments. See the reports of the National Research Council13,14 and Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology15 for more information about attribute disclosure risks.16 Identification-disclosure risk measures are often based on estimates of the probabilities that individuals can be identified in the released data. Probabilities of identification are easily interpreted: the larger the probability, the greater the risk. Stewards determine their own threshold for unsafe probabilities. A variety of approaches have been used to estimate these probabilities.17–22 People who are unique in the population (as opposed to the sample) are particularly at risk.23 Therefore, much research has gone into estimating the probability that a sample unique record is in fact a population unique record.24,25 Usefulness of the data is usually assessed with 2 general approaches: (1) comparing broad differences between the original and released data and (2) comparing differences in specific models between the original and released data. Broad difference measures essentially quantify some statistical distance between the distributions of the data on the original and released files, for example, a Kullback-Leibler or Hellinger distance.26 As the distance between the distributions grows, the overall quality of the released data generally drops.27,28 Comparison of measures based on specific models is often performed informally. For example, the steward looks at the similarity of point estimates and standard errors of regression coefficients after fitting the same regression on the original data and on the data proposed for release. If the results are considered close (eg, if the confidence intervals obtained from the models largely overlap), the released data have high utility for that particular analysis.29 Such measures are closely tied to how the data are used, but they provide a limited representation of the overall quality of the released data. Thus, it is prudent to examine models that represent a wide range of uses of the released data. Risks can be reduced by altering data, using one or more statistical-disclosure-limitation strategies. Common approaches include coarsening, data swapping, noise addition, and synthetic data. Examples of coarsening include releasing geography as aggregated regions, reporting exact values only below or above certain thresholds (known as top or bottom coding), collapsing levels of categorical variables, and rounding numerical values. Recoding reduces disclosure risks by turning atypical records—which generally are most at risk—into typical records. Recodes frequently are specified to reduce estimated probabilities of identification to acceptable levels (eg, no cell in a cross-tabulation of a set of key categorical variables has fewer than k individuals, where k is often 3 or 5). Data swapping refers to switching the data values for selected records with those for other records.30 The protection afforded by swapping is based in large part on perception: data stewards expect that intruders will be discouraged from linking to external files, as any apparent matches could be incorrect due to the swapping. The details of the swapping mechanism are almost always kept secret to reduce the potential for reverse engineering. Adding random noise to sensitive or identifying data values can reduce disclosure risks because errors are introduced into the released data, making it difficult for intruders to match on the released values with confidence.31,32 For numerical data, typically, the noise is generated from a distribution with a mean of zero to ensure point estimates of means remain unbiased, although the variance associated with those estimated mean may increase. However, zero-mean noise still can lead to attenuation in point estimates of correlations and regression coefficients. Partially synthetic data methods replace some collected values, such as sensitive values at high risk of disclosure or values of key identifiers, with multiple imputations.8,33–35 For example, suppose that the steward wants to replace income when it exceeds $100,000—because the steward considers only these individuals to be at risk for disclosure—and is willing to release all other values as collected. (Alternatively, the steward could synthesize the key identifiers for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000 with the goal of reducing risks that these individuals might be identified.) The steward generates replacement values for the incomes over $100,000 by randomly simulating from the distribution of income conditional on all other variables. To avoid bias, this distribution must be conditional on income exceeding $100,000. The distribution is estimated using the collected data and possibly other relevant information. This yields one synthetic dataset. The steward repeats this process multiple times and releases the multiple datasets to the public. The multiple datasets enable secondary analysts to reflect the uncertainty from simulating replacement values in inferences. Among the restricted-data techniques described here, partial synthesis is the newest and least commonly used. A stronger version of synthetic data is full synthesis, in which all values in the released data are simulated.36,37 This approach may become appealing in the future, if confidentiality concerns grow to the point where no original data can be released in unrestricted public use files. CONCLUSION To reproduce research conducted on confidential data, researchers will likely need access to the same confidential data used by the original investigators. It is possible in some cases for restricted-data methods to be used, but for the purpose of reproducibility, restricted-access methods hold more promise. This is not to say that restricted-data methods do not have their place, as they enable many other benefits of data sharing. For both restricted data and restricted access, the methods that we describe may be too cumbersome for individual researchers to implement independently. We believe it is incumbent upon research institutions and sponsors, journals, and other advocates of reproducibility to facilitate sharing of confidential data by establishing procedures and policies for sharing confidential data and perhaps creating confidential data repositories. Authors who obtain their confidential data from such repositories could comply with a data-sharing invitation such as the one put forth by Epidemiology by providing detailed instructions for obtaining the confidential data.

Using the 2014–2018 American Community Survey, we examine whether Asians are delaying marriage and whether their postponement of marriage is offset by a rise in cohabitation. When doing so, we pay close attention to variations by ethnicity and immigrant generational status. We find that there is a substantial generational decline in marriage among Asians, accompanied by a relatively small increase in cohabitation. Thus, it is likely that 1.5-generation and U.S.-born Asians are waiting longer to enter coresidential partnerships than Asians who immigrated to the U.S. after age 12 and U.S.-born whites. Also, there are ethnic variations: cohabitation is rare among Indians whereas it is more common for Japanese and Filipino/as. The distinct patterns of 1.5-generation and U.S.-born Asians suggest that they are selectively acculturating. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Asians should not be treated as a monolithic group when studying their demographic and social patterns.",2020,2020-06-01,4,Daeshin Hayden Ju; Karen Amaka Okigbo; Sejung Sage Yim; Jessica Halliday Hardie,"The Graduate Center, CUNY; The Graduate Center, CUNY; The Graduate Center, CUNY; The Graduate Center, CUNY; Hunter College",Family Dynamics and Relationships; Intergenerational Family Dynamics and Caregiving; Demographic Trends and Gender Preferences,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,06,"Ju, Daeshin Hayden; Okigbo, Karen Amaka; Yim, Sejung Sage; Hardie, Jessica Halliday. 2020.

This research reveals large and persistent productivity differences across businesses, even within narrowly defined industries. These differences vary by industry and time and are related to productivityenhancing reallocation. Dispersion in productivity across businesses can provide information about the nature of competition and frictions within sectors, and about the sources of rising wage inequality across businesses. Because there were no official statistics providing this level of detail, BLS and the Census Bureau partnered to create measures of within-industry productivity dispersion. These measures complement official BLS aggregate industry-level productivity growth statistics and thereby improve our understanding of the rich productivity dynamics in the U.S. economy.

Second, this decline is particularly pronounced among young and small firms, while the share of high-growth firms has been relatively stable among large and old firms.

Fourth, the use of transactions-level data opens the door to new methods for tracking product turnover and other sources of product quality change that may be biasing the key national indicators.

Earnings trajectories are presented for workers with credentials by demographic group, including age, race/ethnicity, gender, and educational attainment. To obtain more causal estimates of the labor market impacts of credentials, the authors implement a coarsened exact matching strategy to compare outcomes between otherwise similar people with and without credentials.

Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-opportunity-atlas/. A summary of the related publication follows. We construct a publicly available atlas of children’s outcomes in adulthood by Census tract using anonymized longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population. For each tract, we estimate children’s earnings distributions, incarceration rates, and other outcomes in adulthood by parental income, race, and gender. These estimates allow us to trace the roots of outcomes such as poverty and incarceration back to the neighborhoods in which children grew up. We find that children’s outcomes vary sharply across nearby tracts: for children of parents at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, the standard deviation of mean household income at age 35 is $5,000 across tracts within counties. We illustrate how these tract-level data can provide insight into how neighborhoods shape the development of human capital and support local economic policy using two applications. First, we show that the estimates permit precise targeting of policies to improve economic opportunity by uncovering specific neighborhoods where certain subgroups of children grow up to have poor outcomes. Neighborhoods matter at a very granular level: conditional on characteristics such as poverty rates in a child’s own Census tract, characteristics of tracts that are one mile away have little predictive power for a child’s outcomes. Our historical estimates are informative predictors of outcomes even for children growing up today because neighborhood conditions are relatively stable over time. Second, we show that the observational estimates are highly predictive of neighborhoods’ causal effects, based on a comparison to data from the Moving to Opportunity experiment and a quasi-experimental research design analyzing movers’ outcomes. We then identify high-opportunity neighborhoods that are affordable to low-income families, providing an input into the design of affordable housing policies. Our measures of children’s long-term outcomes are only weakly correlated with traditional proxies for local economic success such as rates of job growth, showing that the conditions that create greater upward mobility are not necessarily the same as those that lead to productive labor markets.

For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/differential-privacy/. A summary of the related publication follows. Releasing statistics based on small samples – such as estimates of social mobility by Census tract, as in the Opportunity Atlas – is very valuable for policy but can potentially create privacy risks by unintentionally disclosing information about specific individuals. To mitigate such risks, we worked with researchers at the Harvard Privacy Tools Project and Census Bureau staff to develop practical methods of reducing the risks of privacy loss when releasing such data. This paper describes the methods that we developed, which can be applied to disclose any statistic of interest that is estimated using a sample with a small number of observations. We focus on the case where the dataset can be broken into many groups (“cells”) and one is interested in releasing statistics for one or more of these cells. Building on ideas from the differential privacy literature, we add noise to the statistic of interest in proportion to the statistic’s maximum observed sensitivity, defined as the maximum change in the statistic from adding or removing a single observation across all the cells in the data. Intuitively, our approach permits the release of statistics in arbitrarily small samples by adding sufficient noise to the estimates to protect privacy. Although our method does not offer a formal privacy guarantee, it generally outperforms widely used methods of disclosure limitation such as count-based cell suppression both in terms of privacy loss and statistical bias. We illustrate how the method can be implemented by discussing how it was used to release estimates of social mobility by Census tract in the Opportunity Atlas. We also provide a step-by-step guide and illustrative Stata code to implement our approach.",2022,2022-01-01,0,Raj Chetty; John N.

Using a unique nonrural subsample from a large national survey (the American Housing Survey) at three time points that allows placing respondents in blocks and census tracts, this study tests the appropriate level of aggregation of the structural characteristics hypothesized to affect block-level perceptions of crime and disorder. I find that structural characteristics differ in their effects based on the level of aggregation employed. While the effects of racial/ethnic heterogeneity are fairly robust to the geographical level of aggregation, the stronger effects, when measured at the level of the surrounding census tract, suggest more dispersed networks are important for perceived crime and disorder. In contrast, economic resources only show a localized effect when aggregating to the block-level and differ based on the outcome; higher average income reduces disorder but increases crime, most likely by increasing the number of attractive targets. Additionally, the presence of broken households has a localized effect for social disorder but a more diffuse effect for perceived crime. These findings suggest the need for neighborhood studies of crime rates, as well as the broader neighborhood effects literature, to consider the mechanisms involved when aggregating various structural characteristics.",2007,2007-10-01,396,John R.

In contrast to studies aggregating to larger units, it is found that greater residential stability in the micro-neighbourhood increases reported neighbourhood satisfaction. A low socioeconomic status of the local micro-neighbourhood decreases neighbourhood satisfaction more than does the socioeconomic status of the surrounding tract and this effect is amplified in low-income tracts.

This standardized coefficient was .71 on average over the seven waves. Models simultaneously taking into account both violent and property crime found a consistently strong positive effect for violent crime but a consistently negative effect for property crime. Among types of violent crime, robbery and aggravated assault have the strongest effect on the perception of crime in the tract.

This study employs a unique sample (the American Housing Survey neighborhood sample) focusing on housing units nested in microneighborhoods across three waves from 1985 to 1993. This format allows one to test and find that such racial/ethnic transformation occurs because of the following effects: First, White households that perceive more crime in the neighborhood or that live in microneighborhoods with more commonly perceived crime are more likely to move out of such neighborhoods. Second, Whites are significantly less likely to move into a housing unit in a microneighborhood with more commonly perceived crime.

This study proposes addressing this challenge with several theoretically motivated refinements using a large spatially stratified sample of residents in the Western United States. First, we consider various distinct types of social relationships, and find that our novel measure of neighborhood safety ties is much more strongly related to perceived collective efficacy than is a measure of socializing relationships. Second, we explicitly account for the spatial distribution of ties, and find that it is not just local neighborhood ties that increase a sense of cohesion or informal social control, but that more spatially distant ties also matter. Third, we make a distinction between urban and rural areas, finding that in rural areas, social ties from an even broader area are associated with stronger feelings of collective efficacy.KEYWORDS: Neighborhoodssocial networksspatial effectscollective efficacy Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Additional informationFundingThis research is supported in part by NSF grants [IIS-1526736 and BCS-0827027].Notes on contributorsJohn R.

We demonstrate the problem using a 100% transcription of microdata from the 1940 census. By drawing many samples from two major cities, we confirm a known pattern: random samples yield unbiased point estimates of means or proportions, but estimates based on smaller samples have larger average errors in measurement and greater risk of large error. Sampling variability also inflates estimates of measures of variation across areas (reflecting segregation or spatial inequality). This variation is at the heart of much contemporary spatial analysis. We then evaluate possible solutions. For point estimates, we examine three Bayesian models, all of which reduce sampling variation, and we encourage use of such models to correct ACS small area estimates. However, the corrected estimates cannot be used to calculate estimates of variation, because smoothing toward local or grand means artificially reduces variation. We note that there are potential Bayesian approaches to this problem, and we demonstrate an efficacious alternative that uses the original sample data.",2019,2019-07-10,8,John Logan; Cici Bauer; Jun Ke; Hongwei Xu; Fan Li,"Brown University; The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston; Brown University; Queens College, CUNY; Yale University",Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Housing Market and Economics,Geographical Analysis,07,"Logan, John; Bauer, Cici; Ke, Jun; Xu, Hongwei; Li, Fan. 2019.

Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, as there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own retabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by the National Historical Geographic Information Systems (NHGIS) uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn.

In every decennial census many tracts are split, consolidated, or changed in other ways from the previous boundaries to reflect population growth or decline. We examine two interpolation methods to create a bridge between years, one that relies only on areal weighting and another that also introduces population weights. Results demonstrate that these approaches produce substantially different estimates for variables that involve population counts, but they have a high degree of convergence for variables defined as rates or averages.

Both national and local policymakers in the U.S. have called for efforts to increase the stock of college graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, but data availability has thus far prevented researchers from directly connecting STEM education to human capital externalities. This paper uses the 2009-2011 American Community Survey to examine the external effects of college graduates in STEM and non-STEM fields on the wages of other workers in the same metropolitan area. I find that both types of college graduates create positive wage externalities, but STEM graduates create much larger externalities.",2013,2013-01-01,13,John V.

Previous research suggests that married women with families value the flexibility that self-employment can offer, allowing them to balance their family responsibilities with their career aspirations. This may be especially true for college graduates, who tend to have more successful businesses. Access to childcare may also affect their labor force decisions.Using American Community Survey microdata, we examine how birth-place residence, a proxy for access to extended family and child care, relates to self-employment and hours worked for college-graduate married mothers. Our results suggest that flexibility is a major factor pulling out-migrant college-educated mothers into self-employment. Additionally, it appears that, in response to fewer childcare options, self-employed mothers away from their birth-place work fewer hours, while self-employed mothers residing in their birth place are able to work more hours per week.",2019,2019-01-01,0,Zhengyu Cai; Heather Stephens; John V.

Central to our analysis is a proxy measure of working in the primary or secondary sector of the segmented labor market. Our results indicate that a larger proportion of foreign-born workers are essential frontline workers compared to native-born workers and that 70 percent of unauthorized immigrant workers are essential frontline workers. Disparities in essential frontline worker status are most pronounced for unauthorized immigrant workers and native-born workers in the secondary sector of the labor market. These results suggest that larger proportions of foreign-born workers, and especially unauthorized immigrant workers, face greater risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace than native-born workers. Social determinants of health such as lack of access to health insurance and living in overcrowded housing indicate that unauthorized immigrant essential frontline workers may be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes related to COVID-19 than other groups of essential frontline workers.

THE ROLE OF INTERINDUSTRY LINKAGES IN U.S. MANUFACTURING,"There is considerable empirical evidence that energy prices had a large effect on the U.S. economy between World War II and the 1980s. This paper argues that linkages between manufacturing industries amplify the effect of an energy price shock and help explain the large effect. In particular, energy‐intensive industries are important input suppliers to other industries. When the price of energy increases, energy‐intensive industries contract, raising materials prices for other industries. Because of the reduction in materials supply, the downstream industries also contract, which I refer to as the supply effect. Using data from the Census of Manufactures, I find that the supply effect accounted for about one half of the sensitivity of value added to the price of energy. I use plant‐level census data to show that the supply effect caused similar changes in value added per plant as in value added per industry. A price increase caused a small, although statistically significant, decrease in entry and had no effect on exit. Finally, the supply effect reduced plant‐level labor demand .

His influential article in the American Economic Review in 1961 prompted substantial research measuring industrial structure at the regional scale and examining its relationships to economic outcomes. A considerable portion of this work operationalized the concept of regional industrial structure as sectoral diversity, the degree to which the composition of an economy is spread across heterogeneous activities. Diversity is a relatively simple construct to measure and interpret, but does not capture the implications of Chinitz’s ideas fully. The structure within regional industries may also influence the performance of business enterprises. In particular, regional intra-industry concentration - the extent to which an industry is dominated by a few relatively large firms in a locality - has not appeared in empirical work studying economic performance apart from individual case studies, principally because accurately measuring concentration within a regional industry requires firm-level information. Multiple establishments of varying sizes in a given locality may be part of the same firm. Therefore, secondary data sources on establishment size distributions (such as County Business Patterns or aggregated information from the Census of Manufactures) can yield only deceptive portrayals of the level of regional industrial concentration.

Empirical Evidence for Nonequivalent Market Power Effects of Tariffs and Quotas,"Over the past 50 years, the steel industry has been protected by a wide variety of trade policies, both tariff- and quota-based. We exploit this extensive heterogeneity in trade protection to examine the well-established theoretical literature predicting nonequivalent effects of tariffs and quotas on domestic firms' market power. Using plant-level Census Bureau data for steel plants from 1967-2002, we find evidence for significant market power effects for binding quota-based protection, but not tariff-based protection, particularly with respect to integrated and minimill steel producers. Our results are robust to calculation with two standard measures of market power and controlling for potential endogeneity of trade policies.",2012,2012-03-01,0,Bruce A. Blonigen; Benjamin H.

We found that the Vietnamese brides tended to be much less educated than the Filipina brides. This difference, together with the fact that the former tended to be much weaker in English language ability than the latter, contributed to (1) the finding that the Vietnamese brides had a lower employment rate than did the Filipina brides, and (2) the finding that the economic niche of the employed Vietnamese brides (in the salon sector) tended to yield substantially lower wages than did the economic niche of the employed Filipina brides (in the medical service sector). Since better-educated brides had a better chance to get married to better-educated husbands, we naturally found that the husbands of the Vietnamese brides tended to be less educated than the husbands of the Filipina brides. However, the gap in educational attainment between the two groups of husbands was substantially smaller than the corresponding gap between the two groups of the brides. Underlying this gender difference was the fact that in addition to educational status, beauty and pleasant personality were also important criteria for selecting wives, and the possibility that beauty and pleasant personality were not positively correlated with educational status. With respect to household income, the gap between the two groups of brides was not large, partly because of the strong tendency of the Vietnamese brides toward hypergamy. A nice finding was that both Filipina and Vietnamese wives of American citizens were at rather low risk of being in poverty. The rather negative images of foreign brides in higher-income Asian countries conveyed by many ethnographic studies have been countered by our more sanguine finding about the Vietnamese and Filipina brides in the United States. With respect to the idea that women in lower-income countries tend to accept hypogamy at the personal level in order to achieve hypergamy at the societal level, it was moderately supported by the Filipina cases but largely negated by the Vietnamese cases.",2012,2012-06-01,4,Kao‐Lee Liaw; Ting Huang,McMaster University; McMaster University,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Intergenerational Family Dynamics and Caregiving",,06,"Liaw, Kao‐Lee; Huang, Ting. 2012.

Based on the merged micro data of the 2005, 2006, and 2007 American Community Surveys, we have found several features of the Japan-born Japanese residents in the United States that can be interpreted as reflections of the strong influences of the male breadwinner model and the Japanese-style employment system on the Japanese in Japan. These features include (1) the high proportion of post-secondary students being undergraduate rather than graduate students, (2) strong female-domination in the sex-compositions of both students and non-students, and (3) among non-students, very large gender gaps in educational attainment, employment rate, and wage level. For the subpopulation of the Japan-born Japanese brides of non-Japan-born American citizens, these influences were also reflected in their strong tendency to be in hypergamy and their relatively low employment rate.

To achieve better insights, the Japan-born residents are compared with their counterparts born in India, the Philippines, and Germany. Our main finding is that the wage pattern of Japanese-born males is radically different from those of their Indian-born and Philippine-born counterparts: (1) their wage level rises sharply as their current age increases from 25-29 to 45-49, (2) the wage premium of achieving a post-graduate degree over bachelor’s degree is very small and statistically insignificant, (3) the wage level of recent arrivals is substantially higher than that of earlier arrivals, and (4) those who arrived at relatively older ages earn substantially higher wages. In addition to the fact that many of these Japanese-born males were dispatched from Japan by Japanese corporations, this paradoxical finding suggests that their wage pattern is influenced substantially by Japan’s social norms and employment practices. Being relegated to secondary economic roles or excluded from the Japanese employment system, Japanese-born females have diverse psychological and socioeconomic reasons for migrating to the United States and are found to have a wage pattern that deviates less from those of their counterparts born in India and the Philippines. Although the wage pattern of German-born males also deviates to some extent from those of their Indian-born and Philippine-born counterparts, they differ markedly from Japanese-born males in having a very large wage premium for having completed postgraduate education.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Kazumasa Hanaoka; Kao‐Lee Liaw,Tohoku University; McMaster University,"Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Japanese Journal of Human Geography,01,"Hanaoka, Kazumasa; Liaw, Kao‐Lee. 2015.

Firms improve their existing products through internal innovation while entering others' product markets through external innovation. We introduce novel friction termed imperfect technology spillovers, which refers to friction in learning others' technology in the process of external innovation. In contrast to existing models, this friction allows incumbent firms to defend themselves from competitors by building technological barriers through internal innovation. Using firm-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau integrated with firm-level patent data, we find regression results consistent with the model predictions. Our counterfactual analysis shows that rising competition leads incumbent firms to undertake (i) more (less) internal innovation for the products they have a (no) technological advantage in, and (ii) less external innovation. This compositional change in firm innovation affects overall innovation in the aggregate economy in different directions depending on the costs of external innovation. Specifically, the shift in innovation composition in response to rising competition decreases overall innovation in the U.S. while increasing that in an economy with high external innovation costs. These findings highlight that the change in innovation composition resulting from firms' strategic choices is an important margin to understand the heterogeneous effect of increasing competition on overall innovation across different countries.",2021,2021-01-01,0,Karam Jo; Seula Kim,"Korea Development Institute; University of Maryland, College Park","Economic Growth and Productivity; Firm Innovation and Growth; Energy, Environment, Economic Growth",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Jo, Karam; Kim, Seula. 2021.

The majority of research devoted to the study of formal help-seeking among survivors of IPV focuses on incident- and individual-level factors and their relationship with formal resource utilization. Much less is known about community-level factors. Using a nationally representative sample of incidents of IPV from the National Crime Victimization Survey (2006–2016), this work explores how law enforcement and social service resources in a community are related to police notification and survivor acquisition of a victim service after an incident of IPV, net of incident- and individual-level factors. Logistic regression models indicate that the number of law enforcement personnel per 1,000 residents in a county is positively associated with police notification after an incident of IPV, and it exerts an indirect effect on survivor service acquisition through police notification. Additional analyses reveal that the race/ethnicity of the survivor of IPV is a key demographic in the explanation of this relationship, as incidents of IPV involving White and Hispanic survivors of IPV are more likely to come to the attention of police as the number of law enforcement personnel increases. The reverse is true for incidents involving Black survivors of IPV. No differences across survivor sex emerged. Potential reasons to account for varying effects across race/ethnicity are discussed as well as the importance of additional funding for police and social service agencies to serve survivors of IPV and meet the dual goals of offender accountability and survivor safety and well-being.",2020,2020-05-18,11,Megan Bears Augustyn; Katherine Calle Willyard,The University of Texas at San Antonio; Texas A&M University,Intimate Partner and Family Violence; Crime Patterns and Interventions; Sexual Assault and Victimization Studies,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,05,"Augustyn, Megan Bears; Willyard, Katherine Calle. 2020.

The estimates have been downloaded tens of thousands of times and widely used for planning, diverse applications, and research. Census 2020 should allow the series to extend through the 2010–2020 decade. The accuracy of new estimates, however, could be challenged by differentially private (DP) disclosure avoidance techniques in Census 2020 data products. This research brief estimates the impact of DP implementation on the accuracy of county-level net migration estimates. Using differentially private Census 2010 demonstration data, we construct a hypothetical set of DP migration estimates for 2000–2010 and compare them to published estimates, using common accuracy metrics and spatial analysis. Findings show that based on demonstration data released in 2020, net migration estimates by five-year age groups would only be accurate enough for use in about half of counties. Inaccuracies are larger in counties with populations less than 50,000, among age groups 65 and over, and among Hispanics. These problems are not fully resolved by grouping into broader age groups. Moreover, errors tend to cluster spatially in some regions of the country. Ultimately, the ability to generate accurate net migration estimates at the same level of detail as in the past will depend on the Census Bureau’s allocation of the privacy loss budget.",2021,2021-07-08,18,Richelle Winkler; Jaclyn L.W.

These restricted data are accessible to researchers around the U.S. via the Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC) network. The major shortcoming of this infrastructure is that it lacks linkable files from the decennial censuses of 1950 through 1990. Full-count microdata from these censuses are available for research, but datasets from these years do not include respondent names and therefore have not been linked over time. Respondent names for these censuses are available only via the original census returns, which are stored on 258,000 reels of microfilm.&#x0D; The Decennial Census Digitization and Linkage project (DCDL) is an initiative to recover names from the 1960-1990 censuses and to produce linked restricted microdata files for research use. We describe the results of a pilot project we completed on the 1990 census. For that pilot, we created digital images from census microfilm, hand-keyed ""truth data"" from those images, supported two teams' attempts to conduct Handwriting Recognition on the images, appended recovered names to already-existing microdata files, and linked the new 1990 census microdata records to previous and subsequent censuses. We describe our processes, the accuracy of the Handwriting Recognition, and the accuracy of the record linkage with the recovered names. We conclude by providing an update on the recently-initiated project to carry out these processes on a production scale for the 1960 through 1990 censuses.&#x0D; When combined with existing linkages between the censuses of 1940, 2000, 2010, the soon-to-be public 1950 census, and the future 2020 census, DCDL will provide the final component in a massive longitudinal data infrastructure that covers most of the U.S. population since 1940. As a multi-purpose statistical tool, the DCDL will further the U.S. Census Bureau's mission to provide high quality data on the U.S. population and support cutting-edge research in the FSRDC network.

Exposure to the Colorado Family Planning Initiative at high school ages was associated with a population-level increase of 1.8–3.5 percentage points in women's on-time bachelor's degree attainment, which represents a 6–12 percent increase in women obtaining their degrees compared with earlier cohorts. Federal and state policies restricting or expanding access to the full range of contraceptive methods can affect women's attainment of higher education in addition to their reproductive health.",2022,2022-12-01,13,Sara Yeatman; James Flynn; Amanda Jean Stevenson; Katie R.

The U.S. has seen falling marriage rates, and increases in multigenerational households and complex families, young children living with grandparents, and adult children living with parents. Robust parent-child linkages are critical to understand these demographic shifts.&#x0D; Objectives and ApproachWe construct and validate parent-child linkages over a century to observe how U.S. households are changing over time. The three largest person-based datafiles in the U.S. are the decennial censuses, the Social Security Administration transaction file, and individual tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service. These sources operationalize relationships differently, capture data at various frequencies, and gather the data for unique purposes. We use probabilistic matching to observe and reconcile parent-child relationships across these sources. The data include a variety of personal identifiers including name, date of birth, parents’ names, address, and place of birth that support matching and validation.&#x0D; ResultsWe find that understanding the content, consistency, and coverage of the files before matching is critical for high quality linkages. The representativeness of the parent-child relationship file improves over time, with the weakest coverage for the Greatest Generation and the strongest coverage for Millennials. Coverage varies by source: tax data underrepresent non-white children and have duplicate records for SSNs, while names and dates of birth are missing from Census data. Multiple match rates differ among demographic groups and over time. In the matching process, the blocking variables rely on common variables across the population datasets. Our approach provides robust entity resolution for women, despite married-maiden name changes. We describe challenges due to data problems in old census records and validation changes in social security data.&#x0D; Conclusion/ImplicationsWe conduct a successful reconciliation of parent-child relationships in U.S. population level files. The project supports operational and research uses, such as the 2020 Census. We will extend this work using graph matching and will expand the method to validate other relationship links including spouses and siblings.",2018,2018-09-05,1,Amy O’Hara; Katie R.

In the United States, scholars face a choice: they can situate fertility in a life course perspective using panel data, which is typically representative only at the national level; or they can attend to subnational contexts using rate schedules, which do not include information on life course statuses. The method and data source we introduce here, Census-Held Linked Administrative Records for Fertility Estimation (CLAR-FE), permits both. It derives fertility histories and rate schedules from U.S. Census Bureau–held data for the nation and by state, racial and ethnic subgroups, and the important life course status of parity. We generate three types of rates for 2000–2020 at the national and state levels by race and ethnicity: age-specific rates and both unconditional and conditional parity- and age-specific rates. Where possible, we compare these rates with those produced by the National Center for Health Statistics. Our new rate schedules illuminate state and racial and ethnic differences in transitions to parenthood, providing evidence of the important subgroup heterogeneity that characterizes the United States. CLAR-FE covers nearly the entire U.S. population and is available to researchers on approved projects through the Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers.",2024,2024-03-20,0,Leslie Root; Amanda Jean Stevenson; Katie R.

Although women in the USA who live further from an abortion clinic are less likely to obtain an abortion than women who live closer to an abortion clinic, no national study has examined inequality in access to abortion and whether inequality has increased as the number of abortion clinics has declined.MethodsFor this analysis, we obtained data on abortion clinics for 2000, 2011, and 2014 from the Guttmacher Institute's Abortion Provider Census. Block groups and the percentage of women aged 15–44 years by census tract were obtained from the US Census Bureau. Distance to the nearest clinic was calculated for the population-weighted centroid of every block group. We calculated the median distance to an abortion clinic for women in each county and the median and 80th percentile distances for each state by weighting block groups by the number of women of reproductive age (15–44 years).FindingsIn 2014, women in the USA would have had to travel a median distance of 10·79 miles (17·36 km) to reach the nearest abortion clinic, although 20% of women would have had to travel 42·54 miles (68·46 km) or more. We found substantially greater variation within than between states because, even in mostly rural states, women and clinics were concentrated in urban areas. We identified spatial disparities in abortion access, which were broadly unchanged, at least as far back as 2000.InterpretationWe showed substantial and persistent spatial disparities in access to abortion in the USA.

Relative to male earnings inequality, the inequality of couples' earnings is both lower in levels and rises by a smaller amount. We also find that couples' earnings instability is lower in levels compared to male earnings instability and actually declines in the SIPP-SSA data. While wives' earnings played an important role in dampening the rise in inequality and year-to-year variation in resources at the family level, we find that marital sorting and coordination of labor supply decisions at the family level played a minor role. Comparing actual couples to randomly paired simulated couples, we find very similar trends in earnings inequality and instability.

Many commentators have used these numbers to claim that internal migration trends in the U.S. have reached a turning point, in which migrants increasingly prefer urban residences to suburban locales. However, these assertions often rely on problematic definitions of city and suburb, and pay too little attention to demographic variations among migrants. This paper examines whether recent internal migrants in the U.S. are choosing closer‐in destinations, drawing from microdata samples from the American Community Survey since 2005. During this period, there is an overall trend of migrants to the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. choosing to migrate closer to the metropolitan core. However, this trend varies significantly among major demographic groups; whereas younger, single, educated, and white‐collar migrants show evidence of a return to the core, migrants who are blue‐collar, less‐educated, older, and with families remain more suburban. In turn, this analysis suggests that overall trends of “back to the city” migration are producing considerable divergence in the metropolitan destinations of different demographic groups.",2017,2017-01-12,11,Kyle E.

We show that seniors from disadvantaged subgroups are more likely to live in multi- or skip-generational arrangements. Contextual factors associated with more multigenerational living include a less generous safety net and high housing costs. Skip-generational living is associated with high female incarceration rates. Conditional on demographic characteristics and these contextual factors, seniors in multigenerational living arrangements are less likely to be in poverty and those in skip-generational arrangements more likely. Overall, the findings are consistent with the possibility that multigenerational arrangements help families address resource needs, whereas skip-generational arrangements heighten the risk of poverty or reflect crises that do so.",2025,2025-01-01,1,Lucie Schmidt; Lara Shore‐Sheppard; Tara Watson,Smith College; Williams College; Brookings Institution,"Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis; Retirement, Disability, and Employment",RSF The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences,01,"Schmidt, Lucie; Shore‐Sheppard, Lara; Watson, Tara. 2025.

Power plant siting has become increasingly contentious, in part because power plants are a source of numerous negative local externalities including elevated levels of air pollution, haze, noise and traffic. Policymakers attempt to take these local disamenities into account when siting facilities, but little reliable evidence is available about their quantitative importance. This paper examines neighborhoods in the United States where power plants were opened during the 1990s using household-level data from a restricted version of the U.S. decennial census. Compared to neighborhoods farther away, housing values and rents decreased by 3-5% between 1990 and 2000 in neighborhoods near sites. Estimates of household marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid power plants are reported separately for natural gas and other types of plants, large plants and small plants, base load plants and peaker plants, and upwind and downwind households.",2008,2008-01-01,10,Lucas W.

At the same time as financialization has increasingly transformed the market for residential real estate into a vehicle for financial speculation, households at the bottom of the income distribution have been disproportionately affected by rising rents and declining housing affordability. Using data from the decennial Census and the American Community Survey from 1990 to 2020, we investigate the link between absentee ownership and rental affordability across US commuting zones. Panel fixed-effects estimates suggest a 10 percentage-point increase in absentee ownership results in a 6.7% increase in average rent, a 1.6 percentage-point increase in the ratio of median commuting zone rent to median commuting zone income, and an approximately 1.4 percentage-point increase in the share of households in a commuting zone that are rent burdened. These effects are concentrated in commuting zones with large non-white populations, and are particularly severe in commuting zones with a large share of black non-Hispanic residents.

We investigate this issue in the context of property taxes, exploring how accurately households perceive their property tax liabilities and what factors determine misperception. Leveraging a unique national dataset, created by linking Zillow’s ZTRAX data to internal data from the American Community Survey, we first compare survey responses for how much households think they pay in property taxes to how much they actually pay based on municipal administrative records from ZTRAX. While homeowners’ tax perceptions are not substantially biased on average, we observe significant inaccuracy and systematic bias across different household(er) characteristics, institutional settings, and across states. Given that the vast majority of studies in the property tax capitalization literature use data concentrated in one state or locality, we also explore whether variation in tax misperceptions across states can help explain the heterogeneity in property tax effects on home prices.

Two groups of children are considered: those born in the US (native born) and foreign-born children who immigrated prior to age 14 (the 1.5 generation). The analyses are conducted overall, within genders, and within racial and ethnic groups.Bilingualism is more prevalent if the parents are foreign born, less proficient in English, of the same ancestry (linguistic) group, and if the child lives in an ethnic (linguistic) concentration area. Although the effects are relatively smaller, a foreign-born grandparent living in the household increases child bilingualism, while a higher level of parental education tends to decrease it. Children of Asian and especially of Hispanic origin are more likely to be bilingual than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts.

29.0,Completed,How many melting pots?,UCLA,2002.0,2003.0,Vincent K Fu,Comments,article,published,2004.0,2004,1,244-253,https://doi.org/10.1353/urb.2004.0003,Comments,"Mark Duggan: During the past two decades, the U.S. prison population increased by a factor of four, with 1.36 million individuals in state and federal prisons by the end of 2002. An additional 0.80 million were held in local jails, juvenile facilities, and other correctional institutions during that same year.46 One consequence of this growth has been a steady rise in the number of individuals released from prison in each year. For example, approximately 550,000 individuals were released from state prisons in 1999, nearly half the number residing in state prisons at the end of the year. If, as previous studies suggest, these individuals are significantly more likely than the average person to commit crimes, it is plausible that the release of these prisoners has a substantial impact on area-level crime rates. Despite the obvious importance of this issue, no previous study has tackled this question head on. Most research has instead explored whether recently released prisoners violate the terms of their parole and are returned to custody within a certain time after release.47 While these studies have contributed a number of important findings, they cannot be used to estimate the effect of recently released prisoners on area-level crime rates for three reasons. First, individuals released from prison may commit a crime and yet not be caught by the authorities, which tends to understate their effect on crime. Or those released from prison may be targeted by authorities and arrested for crimes that they did not commit, thus to some extent overstating their contribution to crime rates. And [End Page 244] finally, a person released from prison may commit a significant number of crimes before being caught. Thus the outcome variables used in previous studies are clearly an imperfect measure of total criminal activity among recently released prisoners. In the current study, Steven Raphael and Michael Stoll address the research question outlined by estimating the contribution of recently released prisoners to state-level crime rates. To do this, the authors utilize a data set from the Bureau of Justice Statistics that includes the number of individuals released from prison and the number newly committed to prison in each state and in each year from 1977 to 1999.48 Combining these data with crime data from the FBI, demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau, and unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the authors investigate the hypothesis that crime increases in response to an increase in the number released from prison and declines when the number newly committed to prison increases. In essence, the authors are testing a reverse incapacitation effect in the first case and a pure incapacitation effect in the second case. There are several important findings in this study. First, the authors convincingly demonstrate that years in which states release a relatively high number of prisoners are followed by significant increases in crime while the opposite is true for the number imprisoned for the first time. Additionally, the authors find that the magnitude of these two effects is not equal—a person who is imprisoned appears to reduce crime by more than a person released from prison increases it. This is consistent with a number of possible hypotheses that predict criminal tendencies decline following imprisonment, including a positive effect of prison programs on earnings potential or a negative effect of parole supervision on the propensity to commit crime. Raphael and Stoll also find that the impact of prison releases was substantially greater early in the period (1978-84), suggesting that the person released from prison today is much less criminally active than his or her counterpart from two decades ago when prison populations were much lower. Finally, the authors demonstrate that prison releases are not significantly related to changes in crime in those states with powerful parole boards, perhaps because these states can selectively release those individuals who are least likely to commit crimes in the future.

Yet, there is a lack of data to examine the expansion of megaregions and understand prevalent challenges to coordination. We use data from the Census Bureau and the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) to analyze migration patterns within the Northern California Megaregion that combines the San Francisco Bay Area and California Central Valley and highlight different trends underlying regional expansion. We find that people are leaving Bay Area zip codes at the edge of the urbanized area where population growth is robust, migration rates lower, job accessibility is low, rents are nearly as high as the more central locations, and home values are lower, making it difficult to move elsewhere within the Bay Area. Moves into the Central Valley are divided between the suburbs of the main urban centers and isolated towns leading to fragmented growth that increases stress on transportation infrastructure and worsens spatial inequality in the region.",2024,2024-12-21,0,Andre Comandon; Seva Rodnyansky; Marlon G.

Challenges may arise when study staff have limited training in geocoding and linking data, or when non-study staff with appropriate expertise have limited availability, are unfamiliar with a study's population or objectives, or are not affordable for the study team. Opportunities for data breaches may also arise when working with non-study staff who are not on-site. We detail a free, user-friendly protocol for constructing indices of the neighborhood risk environment during multisite, clinic-based cohort studies that rely on participants' protected health information. This protocol can be implemented by study staff who do not have prior training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and can help minimize the operational costs of integrating geographic data into public health projects. This protocol demonstrates how to: (1) securely geocode patients' residential addresses in a clinic setting and match geocoded addresses to census tracts using Geographic Information System software (Esri, Redlands, CA); (2) ascertain contextual variables of the risk environment from the American Community Survey and ArcGIS Business Analyst (Esri, Redlands, CA); (3) use geoidentifiers to link neighborhood risk data to census tracts containing geocoded addresses; and (4) assign randomly generated identifiers to census tracts and strip census tracts of their geoidentifiers to maintain patient confidentiality. Completion of this protocol generates three neighborhood risk indices (i.e., Neighborhood Disadvantage Index, Murder Rate Index, and Assault Rate Index) for patients' coded census tract locations. This protocol can be used by research personnel without prior GIS experience to easily create objective indices of the neighborhood risk environment while upholding patient confidentiality. Future studies can adapt this protocol to fit their specific patient populations and analytic objectives.",2022,2022-12-29,3,Ariann Nassel; Marta Wilson‐Barthes; Chanelle J.

We theorize that both knowledge transfer (proxied by the exiting employee team size) and knowledge spillovers (proxied by experience of the exiting employee team) will aid spin-out performance. However, knowledge transfer, being more rival, will have a greater adverse impact than knowledge spillovers on parent firm performance.

We examine specifically the direct effects of the PFD on Alaska poverty rates over the past several decades, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations: children, elders, and Indigenous peoples. Since children of all ages may receive a PFD, accurate measurement of the effect of the PFD requires adjusting for the under-reporting of income of children in government surveys generating official poverty statistics. After adjusting individual incomes of US Census and American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) households, we find that the PFD reduced Alaska poverty rates from 2.1 to 4.2 percentage points from 1990 through 2019. The effect of the PFD on ameliorating poverty has been even larger for vulnerable Alaska populations. The PFD has reduced poverty rates of rural Indigenous Alaskans from 28 percent to less than 22 percent. The PFD has also played an important role in alleviating of poverty among seniors and children. Aside from the special case of 2020, as much as 50 percent more Alaska children – 15 percent instead of 10 percent – would be living in poor families without PFD income.

Sociologists theorize that income segregation can exacerbate the impacts of income inequality, and have developed indices to measure it at the metro area level, including the information theory index introduced in \citet{reardon2011income}, and the divergence index presented in \citet{roberto2015divergence}. To study their differences, we construct both indices using recent American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of features of the income distribution. Since the elimination of the decennial census long form, methods of computing these estimates must be updated to use ACS estimates and account for survey error. We propose a model-based method to interpolate estimates of features of the income distribution that accounts for this error. This method improves on previous approaches by allowing for the use of more types of estimates, and by providing uncertainty quantification. We apply this method to estimate U.S. census tract-level income distributions using ACS tabulations, and in turn use these to construct both income segregation indices. We find major differences between the two indices in the relative ranking of metro areas, as well as differences in how both indices correlate with the Gini index.",2018,2018-01-01,0,Matthew J.

Previous literature documents so-called ""welcome mat"" effects in other populations but has not explicitly studied older persons dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.

We find that Medicaid expansions to working-age adults increased Medicaid participation among low-income older adults by 1.8 percentage points (4.4 percent). We also find evidence of an ""on-ramp"" effect; that is, low-income Medicare beneficiaries residing in expansion states who were young enough to gain coverage under the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansions before aging into Medicare were 4 percentage points (9.5 percent) more likely to have dual Medicaid coverage relative to similar individuals who either turned 65 before the 2014 expansions or resided in non-expansion states.

Our analysis exploits the different timing across states in the passage of duty-to-bargain laws in a difference-in-difference framework to identify how exposure to teacher collective bargaining affects the long-run outcomes of students. Using American Community Survey (ACS) data linked to each respondent’s state of birth, we examine labor market outcomes and educational attainment for 35-49 year olds. Our estimates suggest that teacher collective bargaining worsens the future labor market outcomes of students: living in a state that has a duty-to-bargain law for all 12 grade-school years reduces earnings by $800 (or 2%) per year and decreases hours worked by 0.50 hours per week. The earnings estimate indicates that teacher collective bargaining reduces earnings by $199.6 billion in the US annually. We also find evidence of lower employment rates, which is driven by lower labor force participation, as well as reductions in the skill levels of the occupations into which workers sort. The effects are driven by men and nonwhites, who experience larger relative declines in long-run outcomes.

Poststratification weights can only correct for selection into the sample based on observables whose distribution is known in the population. Variables such as gender, race, income, and region satisfy this requirement because they are available from the U.S. Census Bureau, but poststratification based on these variables may not eliminate nonresponse bias. I develop an approach for correcting for nonignorable nonresponse bias. Survey respondents can be classified by their “response propensity.” Proxies for response propensity include the number of attempted phone calls, indicators of temporary refusal, and interviewer-coded measures of cooperativeness. We can then learn about the population of nonrespondents by extrapolating from the low-propensity respondents. I apply this new estimator to correct for unit nonresponse bias in the American National Election Study and in a CBS / New York Times preelection poll. I find that nonresponse bias can be a serious problem, particularly for items that relate to political participation. I find that my method is successful in substantially reducing nonresponse bias.

I show that the increased possibility of outsourcing (modeled as a decline in foreign intermediate input prices and an increase in the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic intermediate inputs) should increase labor demand elasticities. I also show that, a decline in the share of unskilled labor, due either to skill biased technological change or to movement of unskilled labor intensive stages abroad, can work in the opposite direction and reverse the increasing trend in elasticities. I then test the predictions of the model using the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database (LRD).

We find that citizenship question response patterns in the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that it is a sensitive question when asked about administrative record noncitizens but not when asked about administrative record citizens. ACS respondents who were administrative record noncitizens in 2017 frequently choose to skip the question or answer that the person is a citizen. We predict the effect on self-response to the entire survey by comparing mail response rates in the 2010 ACS, which included a citizenship question, with those of the 2010 census, which did not have a citizenship question, among households in both surveys. We compare the actual ACS–census difference in response rates for households that may contain noncitizens (more sensitive to the question) with the difference for households containing only U.S. citizens. We estimate that the addition of a citizenship question will have an 8.0 percentage point larger effect on self-response rates in households that may have noncitizens relative to those with only U.S. citizens. Assuming that the citizenship question does not affect unit self-response in all-citizen households and applying the 8.0 percentage point drop to the 28.1 % of housing units potentially having at least one noncitizen would predict an overall 2.2 percentage point drop in self-response in the 2020 census, increasing costs and reducing the quality of the population count.",2019,2019-07-17,28,J.

Practice theory, rooted in sociology, looks at the dynamic interplay between structure and behaviors, while addressing the role of individual agency to help understand the formation, reproduction and changes in culture. We argue that nonfamily firms, having limited exposure and knowledge to a multiplicity of roles that women can take on, will categorize women leaders myopically in a traditional gender-stereotypical framework, thrusting on doubt and conflict and undermining her ability to lead. According to Bourdieu's argument of cultural reproduction, this symbolic violence will result in nonfamily firm women leaders' failure to be seen as legitimate, diminishing their ability to positively impact their firms. On the other hand, family firms, which have historically engaged women in a variety of family and business roles, have an expansive cultural repertoire of knowledge, skills and symbols to constructure new ""strategies of action."" Based on Swidler's cultural toolkit model, this vast cultural knowledge enables family firms to legitimize women's leadership roles, providing her with robust latitude and support in decision making and firm impact. Applying these cultural theories to data from the U.S. Census's Survey of Business Owners, and consistent with prior empirical findings, we show that women leaders of family firms reap higher levels of firm performance compared to their nonfamily firm counterparts.",2024,2024-01-01,1,Eric Kushins; Myriam Quispe‐Agnoli,Berry College,"Family Business Performance and Succession; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",,01,"Kushins, Eric; Quispe‐Agnoli, Myriam. 2024.

We examined rates of anxiety and depression in the United States during the pandemic by demographic characteristics, individual stressors, and COVID-19 infection rates and policy contexts. Methods: We merged data from the April 2020–March 2021 US Household Pulse Survey with state-level data on COVID-19 rates and mitigation policies, including stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, and restaurant closures. We estimated weighted logistic regression models to assess correlates of anxiety and depression. Results: Rates of anxiety and depression peaked in late 2020 at 39% and 32%, respectively. Food insecurity and disrupted medical care were associated with more than twice the odds of anxiety and depression (food insecurity: odds ratio [OR] = 2.58 for anxiety and 2.61 for depression; disrupted medical care: OR = 2.40 and 2.27). Being not employed (OR = 1.32 for anxiety and 1.45 for depression), uninsured (OR = 1.30 and 1.38), housing insecure (OR = 1.41 and 1.34), and experiencing disruptions in education (OR = 1.28 and 1.25) were linked to 25% to 45% increased odds of anxiety and depression. Increases in state COVID-19 infection rates were associated with significantly heightened odds of anxiety and depression (OR = 1.01 for anxiety and depression), but state mitigation policies were not. Conclusions: Levels of anxiety and depression rose during the pandemic, particularly among economically vulnerable individuals and those experiencing economic and service disruptions.

Learning-by-doing, the improvement in business performance with operating experience, motivates firms to forgo current profits in return for future gains and results in intangible outputs that cannot be used as collateral. So, we hypothesize that firms in learning-intensive industries will be less reliant on debt. We find supporting evidence using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Compustat on the U.S. manufacturing sector. Within-firm analysis shows that compared with other industries, firm growth in high-learning industries is associated with a lower increase in debt. Consistent with long-term debt being riskier than short-term debt, a difference-in-difference-type analysis reveals that these associations are stronger for long-term debt than for short-term debt.

Jones, and Sonya R. Porter. For more information, see https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/race/. A summary of the related publication follows. We study the sources of racial and ethnic disparities in income using de-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015. We document three sets of results. First, the intergenerational persistence of disparities varies substantially across racial groups. For example, Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven entirely by large differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Second, differences in family characteristics such as parental marital status, education, and wealth explain very little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Differences in ability also do not explain the patterns of intergenerational mobility we document. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in low-poverty areas, but black-white gaps are larger on average for boys who grow up in such neighborhoods. The few areas in which black-white gaps are relatively small tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood earn more and are less likely to be incarcerated. However, fewer than 5% of black children grow up in such environments. These findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.

Spatial microsimulation models (SMSMs) support planning for human security goals by representing human dynamics through realistic, georeferenced synthetic populations, that a) provide a complete representation of social systems while b) also protecting individual privacy. In this paper, we present UrbanPop, an open and reproducible SMSM framework for analysis of human dynamics with high spatial, temporal, and demographic resolution. UrbanPop creates synthetic populations of demographically detailed worker and student agents, positioning them first at probable nighttime locations (home), then moving them to probable daytime locations (work/school). Summary aggregations of these populations match the granular detail available at the census block group level in the American Community Survey Summary File (SF), providing realistic approximations of the actual population. UrbanPop users can select particular demographic traits important in their application, resulting in a highly tailored agent population.

Industries with relatively greater shares of worker turnover export more of total production, and those with higher job turnover export less. Furthermore, relatively high job turnover hinders industry adjustment following trade liberalization.

This paper explores the hypothesis that the availability of credit at the time of a firm’s founding has a profound effect on that firm’s nature. I conjecture that in times when financial capital is difficult to obtain, firms will need to be built as relatively solid organizations. However, in an environment of easily available financial capital, firms can be constituted with an intrinsically weaker structure. To test this conjecture, I use confidential data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the entire universe of business establishments in existence over a thirty-year period; I follow the life cycles of those same establishments through a period of regulatory reform during which U.S. states were allowed to remove barriers to entry in the banking industry, a development that resulted in significantly improved credit competition. The evidence confirms my conjecture. Firms constituted in post-reform years are intrinsically frailer than those founded in a more financially constrained environment, while firms of pre-reform vintage do not seem to adapt their nature to an easier credit environment. Credit market competition does lead to more entry and growth of firms, but also to complex dynamics experienced by the population of business organizations.",2009,2009-01-01,6,Nicola Cetorelli,Federal Reserve Bank of New York,"Banking stability, regulation, efficiency; Corporate Finance and Governance; Firm Innovation and Growth",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Cetorelli, Nicola. 2009.

We find that fewer than 6% of firms used any of the AI-related technologies we measure, though most very large firms reported at least some AI use. Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, nevertheless was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more-educated, more-experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common alongside indicators of high-growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth-oriented business strategies. Early adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of ""superstar"" cities and emerging hubs led startups' adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow economic and social impacts far beyond this limited initial diffusion, with the possibility of a growing ""AI divide"" if early patterns persist.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2023,2023-01-01,45,Kristina McElheran; J.

Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside more‐educated, more‐experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common in startups displaying indicators of high‐growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth‐oriented business strategies.

Food insufficiency has increased markedly during the economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, with disparities among marginalized populations, and may be associated with substantial health care and social costs. <h3>Objective</h3> To assess whether the introduction of advance payments for the Child Tax Credit in mid-July 2021 was associated with changes in food insufficiency in US households with children. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cross-sectional study used data from several phases of the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau from January 6 to August 2, 2021. The survey had 585 170 responses, representing a weighted population size of 77 165 153 households. <h3>Exposure</h3> The first advance Child Tax Credit payment, received on July 15, 2021. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Household food insufficiency. <h3>Results</h3> The weighted sample of 585 170 respondents was mostly female (51.5%) and non-Hispanic White (62.5%), with a plurality aged 25 to 44 years (48.1%), having a 4-year degree or more (34.7%) and a 2019 household income of $75 000 to $149 999 (23.1%). In the weeks after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit was made (July 21 to August 2, 2021), 62.4% of households with children reported receiving it compared with 1.1% of households without children present (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was a 3.7–percentage point reduction (95% CI, –0.055 to –0.019 percentage points;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) in household food insufficiency for households with children present in the survey wave after the first advance payment of the Child Tax Credit, corresponding to a 25.9% reduction, using an event study specification. Difference-in-differences (−16.4%) and modified Poisson (−20.8%) models also yielded large estimates for reductions in household food insufficiency associated with the first advance payment of the expanded Child Tax Credit. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study suggests that the Child Tax Credit advance payment increased household income and may have acted as a buffer against food insufficiency. However, its expansion and advance payment are only a temporary measure for 2021. Congress must consider whether to extend these changes or make them permanent and improve implementation to reduce barriers to receipt for low-income families.",2022,2022-01-13,87,Paul Shafer; Katherine M.

These monthly payments expired in January 2022 after Congress failed to extend the policy, and the subsequent impact on food insufficiency is currently unknown.To assess whether the expiration of monthly CTC payments in January 2022 was associated with changes in food insufficiency in US households with children.This study used repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative data from multiple waves of the Household Pulse Survey, conducted by the US Census Bureau. Online data collection occurred from July 21, 2021, to July 11, 2022, and data analysis was performed in July 2022.The first missed advance CTC payment on January 15, 2022.The main outcome was unadjusted prevalence of household food insufficiency. Event study specification was used to estimate the association between the expiration of the CTC payments and household food insufficiency with the exposure of being in a household with children present.The sample (592 044 respondents, representing households with and without children, for a weighted population size of 123 350 770 individuals) was majority female (362 286 individuals [51.3%]) and non-Hispanic White (425 497 individuals [62.2%]), and a plurality of respondents (248 828 [48.3%]) were aged 25 to 44 years at the time of the survey. During the survey wave just before CTC expiration (reference wave, December 29, 2021, to January 10, 2022), unadjusted household food insufficiency was 12.7% among households with children. In late January and early February 2022, following the first missed CTC monthly payment, 13.6% of households with children reported food insufficiency, increasing to 16.0% by late June and early July 2022. The event study specification estimated a 3.2 percentage point increase (95% CI, 1.4-5.0 percentage points; P < .001) in food insufficiency by the most recent wave available after the first missed CTC payment (June 29 to July 11, 2022) among households with children compared with the reference wave, a 25% increase.The findings of this study suggest that there was an increase in food insufficiency among households with children after they stopped receiving monthly CTC payments.

Medicaid expansion has significantly expanded the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid and the creation of the health insurance exchanges (Marketplace) under the Affordable Care Act created a very visible avenue through which people can learn that they are eligible. Although many applications are now submitted online, physical access to state, county, and tribal government Medicaid offices still plays a critical role in understanding eligibility, getting help in applying, and navigating required documentation for both initial enrollment and redetermination of eligibility. However, as more government functions have moved online, in-person office locations and/or staff may have been cut to reduce costs, and gentrification has shifted where minoritized, marginalized, and/or low-income populations live, it is unclear if this key local connection point between residents and Medicaid has been maintained. Our objective was to identify and geocode all Medicaid offices in the United States for pairing with other spatial data (e.g., demographics, Medicaid participation, health care use, health outcomes) to investigate policy-relevant research questions. Three coders identified Medicaid office addresses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia by searching state government websites (e.g., Department of Health and Human Services or analogous state agency) during late 2021 and early 2022 for the appropriate Medicaid agency and its office locations, which were then reviewed for accuracy by a fourth coder. Our corpus of Medicaid office addresses was then geocoded using the Census Geocoder from the US Census Bureau (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) with unresolved addresses investigated and/or manually geocoded using Google Maps. The corpus was updated in August through December 2023 following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency by a fifth coder as several states closed and/or combined offices during the pandemic. After deduplication (e.g., where multiple counties share a single office) and removal of mailing addresses (e.g., PO Boxes), our final dataset includes 3,026 Medicaid office locations. 1.0 (December 19, 2023) – original version 2.0 (January 25, 2024) – added related publication (Data in Brief), corrected two records that were missing negative signs in longitude",2023,2023-01-01,1,Paul Shafer; Maxwell Palmer; Ahyoung Cho; Mara Lynch; Pierce H.

1812.0,Active,Effects of Unemployment Insurance Benefits on Job and Match Quality,Georgetown,2018.0,,Adriana Kugler,Expanded unemployment benefits and their implications for health during the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 pandemic,article,published,2021.0,57,1,12-14,https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6773.13881,Expanded unemployment benefits and their implications for health during the <scp>COVID</scp>‐19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has roiled the world since early 2020, which has resulted in over 220 million infections and over 4.5 million deaths as of early September 2021.1 The United States has recently struggled to contain a resurgence of cases associated with the more transmissible Delta variant,2 leading to hospitals again reaching capacity and many states, municipalities, and institutions to re-institute precautions, such as mask mandates and testing requirements, as well as many employers beginning to require that their employees be vaccinated.3-5 Early on, as the United States and the world were still coming to grips with the challenge that we were collectively facing, public health measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 led to a need to support workers who had become unemployed during this pandemic-induced economic crisis. In the United States, unemployment peaked at 14.8% and labor force participation fell to 60.2% in April 2020—their worst in decades.6 Black and Latinx populations experienced the double jeopardy of having disproportionately higher unemployment rates while those still working faced relatively greater COVID exposure risks as essential and frontline workers.6-10 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 by President Donald J. Trump,11 including a Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program that added a $600 weekly supplement to state unemployment insurance (UI) benefits designed to help Americans manage the evolving pandemic financially.12 FPUC ended in July 2020 before being partially reinstated in January 2021 at half the original amount ($300 weekly supplement). Other measures to support workers included the following: (1) Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), also part of the CARES Act and extended in the American Rescue Plan Act, which extended benefits for up to 53 weeks once state benefits are exhausted; (2) Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which extends UI benefits to those not traditionally eligible (e.g., self-employed, independent contractors); and (3) Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), which supports those with eligibility for regular UI benefits who also have income from traditionally ineligible sources. The PUA and MEUC programs are particularly important for equity. Our UI system was designed to disadvantage Black and Latinx workers from the beginning by excluding certain occupations and work arrangements as well as a federalist approach to implementation, which resulted in wide variation in generosity and investment on the part of states, similar to Medicaid.13-15 In this issue, Evangelist, Wu, and Shaefer focus on a key question—how did expanded UI benefits affect health care spending?16 The authors describe how health care use early in the pandemic plummeted for both routine and emergent non-COVID-related care, with concerns about health care costs in the face of large increases in unemployment thought to play a key role alongside reductions in availability of in-person care and avoidance of exposure risk. But disentangling these various motives, as well as state-level differences in UI eligibility on top of the effect of FPUC, was no small feat. The authors used aggregated debit and credit card transaction data at the state-week level obtained from Opportunity Insights for January to August 2020, which captured approximately 10% of US transactions. This approach provided a seasonally adjusted index of health care spending relative to pre-pandemic levels. Their triple differences framework exploits variation in the UI claims rate and availability of FPUC, separating state-level UI benefit eligibility and generosity from the enhanced payment to those receiving UI benefits while also controlling for Economic Impact Payments made in April 2020. They find that health care spending fell by 1.0% from pre-pandemic levels for every percentage point increase in UI claims rate across all states, with a similarly sized effect in Medicaid expansion states (−1.0%) but double in non-expansion states (−2.0%). Without that pathway to coverage and potentially facing the full price for any health care used, it seems plausible that many individuals and families would choose to simply defer care. FPUC offset approximately half of the decline in health care spending associated with increasing unemployment, though it was only significant at the 10% level. However, when stratified by Medicaid expansion status, FPUC offset 80% of the unemployment-related decline in health care spending in expansion states compared with 65% in non-expansion states. This protective effect of FPUC against reductions in health care spending also carried over to all consumer spending, which has implications for spending on food, housing, transportation, and other needs. A considerable limitation of this study is the authors' inability to separate current spending (i.e., copayments at time of visit) from paying for past health care (i.e., cost-sharing from past visits) in their data, which led the authors to make clear that their focus is on spending rather than utilization. Patients could have deferred or chose not to pay bills for past care to increase savings or cover other expenses without necessarily sacrificing current health care use, or they could have done the opposite to avoid going to collections. Also, the inability to capture spending on prescriptions is unfortunate as medication adherence is key for chronic disease management. Observing how reductions in or loss of UI benefits affect medication adherence could potentially bolster the case for continuing UI expansions as a means of protecting against greater non-COVID-related health consequences of the pandemic. Another important consideration is that low-income individuals and Black and Latinx populations are considerably more likely to be unbanked or underbanked, which means that they lack access to a checking, savings, or money market account or use them in combination with alternative financial instruments like payday or title loans.17 This presents a generalizability problem for their study; however, it seems plausible that this bias toward the banked population could understate the size of their observed effects. That said, the unbanked may also face larger barriers to consistent receipt of UI benefits (e.g., checks by mail rather than direct deposit) and likely have worse access to care (e.g., greater chance of being uninsured) so the effect of their inclusion on the findings may be ambiguous. There have been documented improvements in food insecurity, mental health, health-related social needs, and access to health care associated with receiving UI during the COVID-19 pandemic,18-20 which provide important context for this study and our continued policy responses to this crisis. Raifman, Bor, and Venkataramani used data from an online nationally representative longitudinal cohort between April and November 2020, and they found that receipt of UI with FPUC was associated with nearly double the reduction in food insecurity compared to UI without FPUC (−5.9 percentage points vs. −3.0).18 Berkowitz and Basu used data from the cross-sectional Household Pulse Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau to investigate a range of outcomes, and they found relative risk reductions for food insufficiency, missing housing payments, delays in health care, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2) associated with receipt of UI benefits during June and July 2020.19 All the previously highlighted federal UI expansions lapsed in early September 2021, which kicked an estimated 7.5 million Americans off of UI benefits.21 However, about half of the states chose to opt out of some or all of these supplemental UI expansions earlier, with many states doing so as early as June, claiming that overly generous benefits were the reason that employers were having difficulty filling job openings.22 Early evidence suggests that this has not borne itself out in a rapid decrease in unemployment that governors may have expected. A recent working paper using financial services data found that ending expanded UI benefits in states that did so early only increased employment by 4 percentage points while reducing UI receipt by 35 percentage points through early August 2021 among those who had been unemployed and on UI at the end of April 2021.23 The authors found that new earnings from employment only offset 5% of the lost UI benefits on average, with total weekly spending falling by 20%.23 Another analysis that is pre-registered but yet to be peer-reviewed found that net employment did not seem to be responsive to ending expanded UI benefits.24 These results suggest that the termination of pandemic UI benefits will create only pain for American households, which will reverse their protective effects on health and health-related social needs, without the promised or imagined labor market effects. The COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over despite our collective desire for things to return to normal. Expanded unemployment benefits and other expansions of the patchwork social safety net in the United States, such as increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, are key to supporting individuals and families through this crisis. The long-run effects on health equity and income inequality of withdrawing public health measures and financial supports too soon will be disastrous if low-income and minoritized populations are forced to disproportionately bear the costs of this pandemic in ways that will reverberate for years and generations to come.

Even though the industry aggregate shows a small TFP growth rate −0.3%, quartile rank analysis shows that while the lowest productivity quartile plants average 1.9% loss in productivity, the highest productivity quartile plants average 1.1% growth annually. Our results show considerable movements of plants in their productivity rank categories overall and across age groups, and we find that the scale effect contribution to TFP growth accounts for about 90% of TFP growth on average in the industry. These plants extract scale efficiencies over technological progress to fuel TFP growth.

It highlights significant employment security disparities based on race, ethnicity, and income during the pandemic. However, there are no significant gender and racial disparities within the lowest income group when controlling for other conditions. In contrast, gender and racial disparities in EI are much more pronounced among mid-to-high income groups. Non-White individuals were disproportionately affected by job loss due to health and COVID-related employment issues, unlike Whites who faced unemployment more due to other factors. This pattern was more evident among lower-income groups. The trends shifted in later stages, with high-income Black and Hispanic workers becoming more likely to be unemployed due to non-health and non-employment reasons. Middle-income workers across all races were least likely to stop working for reasons other than COVID-related health or employment issues.

We answer this question using the employer-employee matched data administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and detailed resume data recording workers' career trajectories. Exploiting exogenous shocks to firms' debt capacity, we find that better access to debt financing significantly narrows the earnings gap between minority and white workers. Minority workers experience a persistent increase in earnings and also a rise in the pay rank relative to white workers in the same firm. The effect is more pronounced among mid- and high-skill minority workers, in areas where white workers are in shorter supply, and for firms with ex-ante less diverse boards and greater pre-existing racial inequality. With better access to financing, minority workers are also more likely to be promoted or be reassigned to technology-oriented occupations compared to white workers. Our evidence is consistent with access to financing making firms better utilize minority workers' human capital.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Janet Gao; Wenting Ma; Qiping Xu,Andrew McDonough B+ Foundation; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Corporate Finance and Governance; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Firm Innovation and Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Gao, Janet; Ma, Wenting; Xu, Qiping. 2023.

Drawing from the Housing Vacancy Survey for 2011, a representative survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau of more than 16,000 households in New York City, we estimate the effect of housing cost burden on the overall health of renters and the extent to which they have postponed various types of medical services for financial reasons. Results show that higher out-of-pocket rent burdens are associated with worse self-reported health conditions and a higher likelihood to postpone medical services for financial reasons. This relationship is particularly strong for those households with severe rent burdens. In addition, housing cost burden is equally or more important than other physical housing characteristics in explaining the variation in self-reported general health status and health care postponement. These findings are robust across specifications with different degrees of household, unit/building, and neighborhood controls, and among longstanding and newer renters.

Controlling for facility characteristics and various forms of formal environmental regulation, certain community characteristics are found to have additional effects on local APA expenditures. In particular, for the most pollution-intensive industries, larger per capita income is found to increase plant-level APA activity, as is a higher degree of homeownership, a greater concentration of Democratic voters, and being located in a metropolitan area. Meanwhile, a greater presence of manufacturing employees is found to decrease APA expenditures, suggesting a constituency that is more resistant to additional regulation. If local populations can indeed affect pollution abatement activity, they can impact the spatial distribution of pollution, thereby creating pollution haven effects.",2003,2003-12-31,40,Randy A.

Hispanic/Latino Pan-ethnicity and Ancestry Reporting among South American Immigrants to the United States,"This article explores the identification patterns of South American immigrants to the United States, as measured via Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting on the US Census. Using data from the 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 American Community Survey, my analysis reveals four main findings. First, I show significant heterogeneity in identity patterns and in sociodemographic, immigration, and geographic characteristics between South American and Mexican immigrants in the United States. Second, I find that Southern Cone immigrants opt not to report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and “birth-country” ancestry (ancestry that is concordant with birth country, such as Colombian or Chilean) to a greater extent than Andean immigrants and, instead, report more distal “ancestral-origin” ancestries (i.e., Spanish, Japanese, etc.). Third, I show that those immigrants who do report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity are more likely to report “birth-country” ancestry than “ancestral-origin” ancestry, net of other factors. Finally, my analysis demonstrates that Brazilian immigrants chart a different path of identification among South American immigrants and almost unanimously do not report Hispanic/Latino ethnicity while overwhelmingly reporting “Brazilian” ancestry. Taken together, variation in Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and ancestry reporting across South American immigrant groups has implications for their incorporation into US society, as well as for the degree to which these immigrants see themselves as racialized actors in the United States. Some South American immigrant groups (Southern Cone immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New White ethnics,” and others (Andean immigrants) appear to be incorporating as “New Latinos.” Researchers of international migration should carefully consider these identification differences and their implications for the measurement and study of “Hispanic/Latino” immigrants and their descendants in the United States.",2021,2021-03-09,11,Rebecca Anna Schut,University of Pennsylvania,"Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Migration, Health and Trauma",International Migration Review,03,"Schut, Rebecca Anna. 2021.

Still, questions remain as to how temporal and geographic variation in immigration enforcement within and across the U.S. shaped racialized legal status inequities in health and well-being, particularly among those employed in precarious occupations. To fill this gap, we interrogated the links between changes in county-level immigration enforcement and racialized legal status inequalities in musculoskeletal pain and social welfare benefits utilization among U.S. agricultural workers over nearly two decades (2002–2018). We merged data from three sources [(1) restricted-access, geocoded data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) (n = 37,619); (2) county-level immigration enforcement data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC); and (3) population data from the Census and American Community Survey (ACS)] and estimated linear probability models with year, month, and state fixed effects. We show that, in counties with high enforcement rates, workers—especially undocumented workers—were at increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, including pain that was severe. Heightened enforcement was also associated with declines in needs-based benefits utilization, especially among documented and U.S.-citizen non-White workers and undocumented White and non-White workers. Together, these findings highlight how changes in sociopolitical and legal contexts can shift and maintain racialized legal status hierarchies, with especially important consequences for the well-being of vulnerable workers.",2024,2024-03-13,0,Courtney Boen; Rebecca Anna Schut; Nicholas Graetz,University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago; Princeton University,"Employment and Welfare Studies; Migration, Health and Trauma; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research",Population Research and Policy Review,03,"Boen, Courtney; Schut, Rebecca Anna; Graetz, Nicholas. 2024.

The purpose of this study was to track trends in mental health symptoms, use of services, and unmet need for services among US adults, and to delineate variation across demographic strata. Data were drawn from the 2020 US Household Pulse Survey from repeated cross-sectional online surveys collected between April 23 and November 23, 2020 from 1,302,455 US adults, weighted to represent the US population. Survey respondents self-reported their symptoms of anxiety and depression, use of medication and counseling services, and unmet need for services. Reports of probable anxiety and depression rose significantly through the study period, to prevalence rates of 37% and 29%, respectively, by November, 2020, rates more than four times higher than early 2019 US norms. Use of prescription medication, counseling services, and unmet need for mental health services also rose significantly. Prevalence rates of probable mental health disorders were highest among young, less educated, single parent, female, Black and multi-racial respondents, with some vacillation in such disparities over cohorts. Young, female, and moderately educated respondents also reported higher unmet needs for services. Disparities in estimates of mental health disorders and mental health treatment indicate a striking disequilibrium between the potential need for and the use of mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women, with the potential for expanded interruptions to optimal functioning and societal recovery from COVID-19.The myriad stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have impaired mental health and wellbeing. Although evidence from early in the pandemic revealed elevated rates of mental health conditions, research has not documented whether psychological disorders have continued to rise as the pandemic has persisted. In this research, we assess data from over 1.3 million US adults who participated in cross-sectional surveys between April and November, 2020 to track trends in mental health disorder symptoms and services. Our results show that reports of anxiety and depression rose significantly from April to November, 2020 to rates more than four-times higher than in 2019. We also found evidence of growing unmet need for mental health services. Rising mental health challenges are being borne largely by young, less advantaged people of color and women.

Based on the estimation of three sets of regression models for five overlapping samples of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States and five mutually exclusive segments of the labor force, this analysis shows that the finding of a significant linkage between internal migration and immigration depends critically on the empirical experiment used. In direct opposition to previous published research, we conclude that net migration of the native born for metropolitan areas is either positively related or unrelated to immigration. Our models show that the net migration loss of unskilled native workers from metropolitan areas is probably a function of those cities' population size rather than immigrant flow to them.

Nevertheless, parents of multiracial children were asked for the 1990 US Census to report a single race for their offspring. Using confidential 1990 Census micro-data, we investigate the choices parents made for the three most common racially mixed household types (Asian-white, black-white and Latino-white) in twelve large metropolitan areas. We find that context affects the reporting of children's racial identity. We examine these effects with models that incorporate three spatial scales: households, neighbourhoods and metropolitan areas. Model estimates reveal that racial claims made by parents of Latino- and Asian-white (but not black-white) children varied significantly across metropolitan area. A neighbourhood's proportion white increased the probability that parents reported their children as white, while a neighbourhood's racial diversity increased the probability that black-white parents claimed a non-white race (black or ‘other’) for their children.

This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken while the authors were conducting a study approved by the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications. Research results and conclusions expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily indicate concurrence by the Census Bureau. It has been screened to ensure that no confidential information is revealed. Notes 1. This layering will always be imperfect because, as Goldberg observes, the census form ‘lags behind the complex negotiations of identities and (self-) identifications in everyday experience, even as it serves in part to shape and fix those identities and identifications’ (1997, pp. 32–3). 2. Most US research that measures contextual effects on parents’ racial claims for their children has relied on large geographic units (Public Use Microsample Areas) containing a minimum population of 100,000. Our analysis is the first to use considerably smaller census tracts that contain between 4,000 and 8,000 people, because the Census Bureau provided us with access to confidential information on individuals in households by census tract of residence for the 1990 Census. While considerable debate remains in the social science literature about the most appropriate scale of neighbourhood cartography (e.g. Martin 2003 Martin, D. G. 2003. ‘Enacting neighborhood’. Urban Geography, 24(5): 361–85. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]), and we could have used smaller block groups, census tracts are most suitable for two reasons. One, our broader project engages the existing racial residential segregation literature – a literature that predominantly uses census tracts. Two, despite having access to the full one-in-six sample of long-form respondents, our sample sizes remain small. Census tracts seem to us an appropriate compromise between the detail that a smaller geographic unit might provide and the precedent of previous literature and our data demands. 3. We follow demographic convention in treating all respondents that indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question. In so doing we do not assume away the multiple identities subsumed with this meta-category (e.g. those based on national origin, nativity, class and political ideology, among many others). Moreover, we explicitly reject the notion that the terms ‘Latino’ or ‘Hispanic’ mark a meaningful category of ethnic identity. Rather, we see the creation of pan-ethnic Latino/Hispanic identity in the US as a process of racial formation. Also, noting ongoing terminological debates, we use the terms Latino and Hispanic interchangeably. 4. Our larger project includes racial mixing between non-white adults. Because the children from these and other mixed-race pairings were numerically infrequent, we cannot publish such data as we would risk disclosure of information deemed confidential by Census Bureau. 5. Even when women retain the names with which they were born, children still most often carry their father's family name. 6. We assume that parents fill out the census questionnaire in households with young children. 7. We identify mixed-race households as those where the race of the adult male and adult female (where the relationship to the household head is reported as married or partner) differ across the standard race categories used in the 1990 Census (white, black, Asian, Indian, other). We treat all respondents who indicate Latino or Hispanic ancestry as a distinct racial category, regardless of their response to the race question (see note 3 for additional discussion). 8. We configured the sample to mitigate endogeneity between residential location decisions and parents’ views of their children's racial identity. The age restriction improves our assumptions that parents fill out the census form. It also reduces the chance that parents may declare racial identity as children see themselves, which is more likely in older children and reflects non-residential settings. We initially restricted the sample to households that did not move between 1985 and 1990 to eliminate recent residential moves made with children in mind. This restriction, however, removed over two-thirds of the sample. We kept recent movers in the sample and controlled for their residential mobility with a variable in the models. 9. The standard entropy diversity measure for each tract is , where k indexes racial groups, j indexes census tracts and t indexes total tract population. The maximum value of Ej is obtained when tract j's population is evenly divided between the k racial groups. Since the number of racial groups limits the magnitude of the maximum value, we include a scaling constant s so that Ej ranges between 0 and 1. We calculated Ej based on individuals in the six standard racial groups (Latino, white, black, Asian, Native American and other).",2008,2008-07-12,28,Steven R.

Yet in public presentations of census data and population projections, individuals with mixed backgrounds are generally classified as nonwhite. We analyze 2013 American Community Survey data and summarize the results of important studies to argue that individuals from mixed majority-minority backgrounds resemble whites more than they do minorities in terms of some key social characteristics and experiences, such as where they grow up and their social affiliations as adults.

Since many migrants are young people who form families shortly after arrival, there is now a large and rapidly growing second generation - many of them now young adults who recently completed school and started their careers. There is much speculation about whether this second generation will assimilate into the middle class rapidly or form a new urban underclass. The last census to ask parental birthplace questions was 1970, so an absence of data precluded testing hypotheses about the social and economic progress of the new second generation. In 1994, the Census Bureau returned an inquiry about parental birthplace to the Current Population Survey so there is now an annual national sample of about 16,000 second-generation Americans. Data from the 1998 and 2000 surveys were pooled and analyzed. This investigation demonstrates that these comprehensive new data provide valuable descriptive information about today's second generation and permit the cautious testing of hypotheses concerning social and economic assimilation. They reveal a great diversity among the second generation depending upon country of origin but, in most comparisons, today's second generation exceed their first-generation parents in educational attainment, occupational achievement and economic status. In many comparisons, second-generation groups have educational attainments exceeding those of third- and higher-generation whites and African Americans. These data refute the hypothesis that today's second generation will languish in poverty.

It is projected to grow very rapidly in coming decades, and Census Bureau classification practices mean that most of its members are counted as minority.

Digitizing Census of Manufactures manuscripts for 1850 to 1880, we show that as steam costs declined, manufacturing activity grew faster in counties with less waterpower potential. This growth was driven by steam powered entrants and agglomeration, as water powered incumbents faced switching barriers primarily from sunk costs. Estimating a dynamic model of firm entry and steam adoption, we find that the interaction of switching barriers and high fixed costs creates a quantitatively important and socially inefficient drag on technology adoption. Despite substantial entry and exit, switching barriers remained influential for aggregate steam adoption throughout the 19th century, as water power required lower fixed costs and therefore was attractive to relatively low productivity entrants. These entrants then became incumbents, locked into water power even if their productivity grew.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.",2024,2024-01-01,0,Richard Hornbeck; Shanon Hsuan-Ming Hsu; Anders Humlum; Martin Rotemberg,University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; New York University,Electric Power System Optimization; Global trade and economics; Power System Reliability and Maintenance,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Hornbeck, Richard; Hsu, Shanon Hsuan-Ming; Humlum, Anders; Rotemberg, Martin. 2024.

Some portion of segregation is attributable to socioeconomic differences across racial lines (what we call structural factors); some portion is caused by purely racial factors, such as housing market discrimination and preferences for the race of one's neighbors. Past attempts to measure the structural component of segregation have generally focused on only 1 socioeconomic status (SES) variable and have produced results that are high in potential measurement error. In this article, we use an innovative method and uniquely suitable data (geocoded microdata obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau's Research Data Center [RDC] program) to disaggregate segregation into a ""structural"" and a residual component.

This study evaluates the association between distance to care and the abortion rate, adjusting for abortion demand. METHODS Two analyses were conducted using a data set linking provider locations and 2000–2014 county‐level abortion data for 18 states; data sources included the Census Bureau, state vital statistics offices and the Guttmacher Institute. First, a series of linear regression models were run, with and without adjustment for demographic covariates, modeling distance as both a continuous and a categorical variable. Then, an instrumental variable analysis was conducted in which being 30 or more miles from a large college‐enrolled female population younger than age 25 was used as an instrument for distance to a provider. The outcome variable for all models was abortions per 1,000 women aged 25 or older. All models were adjusted for state, year and state‐year interaction fixed effects. RESULTS Increased distance to a provider was associated with a decreased abortion rate. Each additional mile to a provider was associated with a decrease of 0.011 in the abortion rate. Compared with being within 30 miles of a provider, being between 30 and 90 miles from a provider was associated with 0.80–1.46 fewer abortions per 1,000 women. In the instrumental variable analysis, being 30 or more miles from a provider was associated with 5.26 fewer abortions per 1,000 women.

The conventional wisdom on the topic is that in an increasingly integrated global economy with relatively low formal trade barriers, national borders are no longer important inhibitors of trade. McCallum (1995) cast some doubt on this belief when he found that, after adjusting for economic size and geographic distance, trade among Canadian provinces was more than twenty times greater than trade between those same provinces and U.S. states. The 1993 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) provides an unprecedented opportunity to verify these surprising results, as well as to investigate subsequent questions, such as why the border matters, and how it affects economic welfare. This paper reviews the existing literature on the geography of trade flows, describes the CFS, and attempts to verify the McCallum result at the aggregate level. Despite a number of a priori reasons to believe otherwise, the author finds that CFS estimates of the “border effect” are almost exactly equivalent to those estimated by McCallum.",1998,1998-09-01,33,Russell Hillberry,Indiana University,Global trade and economics; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis,Journal of Borderlands Studies,09,"Hillberry, Russell. 1998.

For large domains of interest, direct survey estimates may fare well; however, when interest lies in domains that contain relatively few samples, direct survey estimates are inefficient, leading to the need for small area models. These models rely on various dependencies within the data in order to ""borrow information,"" leading to more precise estimates. Dependencies may include covariates, spatial dependence, temporal dependence, multivariate relationships, or in the case of establishment surveys specifically, dependence on industry classification. Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a natural foundation for modeling sources of dependence, and thus also a natural framework for small area estimation of establishment statistics. Within this Bayesian framework, there are two separate overarching modeling approaches. The first approach is to use area-level models, which treat the direct survey estimates as the response, and then ""smooth"" these estimates through the modeling hierarchy. In contrast, unit-level models, which do not consider the direct estimates, instead, model the sampled units directly. There are positive and negative trade-offs under both approaches and, in this work, we give an overview of various Bayesian methods that fall under both categories.

We adopt a Bayesian implementation of a Hierarchical Generalized Transformation (HGT) model to deal with the non-conjugacy of non-Gaussian data models when estimated using a Latent Gaussian Process (LGP) model. Survey data are usually prone to a high degree of sampling error, and we use covariates that are prone to measurement error as well as those free of any such error. A classical measurement error component is defined to deal with the sampling error in the covariates. The proposed models can be high-dimensional and we employ the notion of basis function expansions to provide an effective approach to dimension reduction. The HGT component lends flexibility to our model to incorporate multi-type response datasets under a unified latent process model framework. To demonstrate the applicability of our methodology, we provide the results from simulation studies and data applications arising from a dataset consisting of the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year period estimates of the total population count under the poverty threshold and the ACS 5-year period estimates of median housing costs at the county level across multiple states in the USA.",2022,2022-01-01,2,Saikat Nandy; Scott H.

Small-area models are comprised of area-level models that relate direct estimators to area-specific covariates, and the alternative unit-level models that directly model survey responses. Both types of models have their advantages and their unique sets of challenges. In this dissertation, we address some of these challenges. Modern complex surveys collect and report data on a variety of topics, and often the response types are not continuous numeric responses but can be categorical, count-valued, or completely non-numeric like text and functional responses. Here we concentrate on multiple types of numeric responses. First, we extend the measurement error modeling paradigm to areal non-Gaussian data, that can be distributed from one or multiple classes of distributions (e.g. Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial etc.), when the covariates are measured with error and spatially correlated. Survey responses are prone to measurement error which can result from a host of different sources and failing to address this error can lead to a biased and erroneous inference. Second, traditional areal-level models tend to model spatial dependence structures based on the nearest-neighbor approach. These models assume that geographically connected areal units exhibit strong correlations and that the strength of this connection grows weaker as we move farther away. We propose a new neighborhood network where the probability of connection between two areal units is determined by not just their geographical proximity, but also their socio-demographic similarity. We embed this in a traditional spatial model, e.g., Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model. Third, we address the issue of computational efficiency while working with data from complex surveys which can include millions of individuals. We introduce Bayesian data sketching algorithms to compress high-dimensional survey data at both the area level and the unit level onto a lower-dimension subspace using random projection matrices. This framework relies on the Bayesian pseudo-likelihood to accommodate the survey design, as well as the Bayesian hierarchical framework to model various dependence structures. We motivate the applications of our proposed frameworks with applications to public use data from American Community Survey (ACS).",2023,2023-08-01,0,Saikat Nandy,,Spatial and Panel Data Analysis; Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; demographic modeling and climate adaptation,,08,"Nandy, Saikat. 2023.

Accordingly, we examine, in a large sample of non-Hispanic (NH) black women, whether low access to healthy food corresponds with increased risk of obesity among residents of low- and high-poverty neighborhoods. In addition, we analyze whether any discovered association between low-food access and obesity appears stronger in neighborhoods with a high proportion of black residents. We retrieved body mass index (BMI) data for 97,366 NH black women residing in 6258 neighborhoods from the California Department of Public Health birth files for years 2007-2010. We linked BMI data with census tract-level data on neighborhood food access from the 2010 Food Access Research Atlas and neighborhood poverty and black composition from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. We applied generalized estimating equation methods that permit analysis of clustered data within neighborhoods. Methods also controlled for individual-level characteristics which might confound the relation between food access and obesity, including health insurance status, age, education, and parity. Results indicate that low-food access does not impact risk of obesity among NH black women residing in low-poverty neighborhoods. However, low-food access varies positively with risk of obesity in high-poverty neighborhoods. Moreover, the association between low-food access and obesity appears stronger in high-poverty, high-black composition neighborhoods, relative to high-poverty, low-black composition neighborhoods. Our findings support the omnibus hypothesis and indicate a potential interaction between factors in the local food and social environments on an individual's risk of obesity.",2019,2019-02-25,17,Samantha Gailey; Tim A.

Children across the income distribution have experienced dramatic improvements in the physical adequacy of their dwellings and in crowding but significant deterioration in housing affordability. Poor children are often in greatest jeopardy, with the rate of complaints about crime 25 percent higher in 2005 than in 1975, and the rate of school complaints twice as high in 2005 than 1975. Poor children also experience little payoff from residential mobility in terms of physical dwelling adequacy, crowding, affordability, or adequacy of schools, though moves are associated with fewer complaints about crime.

We rely on the 1989 American Housing Survey (AHS) and a special data supplement that attempted to accurately categorize every assisted renter‐occupied address in the AHS sample as either public housing; privately owned, federally assisted housing; or certificates and vouchers. Housing outcomes examined are physical condition of the unit, crowding, affordability, perceived neighborhood quality, and crime. We analyze three research questions: (1) Do the characteristics of households enrolled in housing programs differ by program type? (2) Do housing outcomes differ with the type of assistance received? (3) Do differences in household characteristics account for observed differences in program outcomes? The analysis suggests that the housing assistance system channels different types of households with children into different housing programs. The least disadvantaged households are most likely to end up in privately owned assisted stock, while the most disadvantaged end up in public housing. The most notable interprogram difference in housing outcomes relates to neighborhood quality. In contrast to other forms of rental assistance, residence in public housing is associated with a decline in neighborhood quality. This result holds even after controlling for household characteristics and geographic location of the unit.",1993,1993-01-01,34,Sandra J. Newman; Ann B.

We compare the assisted housing occupied by black and white households with children, and examine whether young adult education, employment, and earnings outcomes in 2011 differ between blacks and whites who spent part of their childhood in assisted housing in the 2000s. We use a special version of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) that has been address-matched to federally assisted housing, and the PSID's Transition to Adulthood supplement, along with geocode-matched data from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS), CoreLogic real estate data, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Statistical methods include difference in means, logit and general linear models. We find no evidence of racial disparities in the type of assisted housing program, the physical quality of project-based developments, or the management of public housing developments in the 2000 decade. But black households with children are more likely to live in assisted housing that is located in poorer quality neighborhoods. Multivariate tests reveal that the worse outcomes of black young adults compared with whites disappear once socioeconomic differences are taken into account. The discrepancy in assisted housing neighborhood quality experienced by black and white children makes no additional contribution to predicting young adult outcomes. Nonetheless, black children living in relatively better assisted housing neighborhoods tend to have better outcomes in young adulthood than those who live in poorer quality assisted housing neighborhoods.

The study integrates estimates of chronic cancer risk associated with ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants from the Environmental Protection Agency's National‐Scale Air Toxics Assessment (2005), hazardous chemical accidents from the National Response Center's Emergency Response Notification System (2007–2011), and sociodemographic characteristics from the American Community Survey (2007–2011). Statistical analyses are based on descriptive comparisons, bivariate correlations, and locally derived spatial regression models that account for spatial dependence in the data. Results indicate that neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Hispanic residents, lower percentage of homeowners, and higher income inequality are facing significantly greater exposure to both chronic and acute pollution risks. The non‐Hispanic black percentage is significantly higher in neighborhoods with greater chronic cancer risk, but lower in areas exposed to acute pollution events.

Findings from generalized estimating equation analyses demonstrate that increased cancer risks from HAPs are significantly associated with neighborhoods having relatively high concentrations of resident same-sex partner households, adjusting for geographic clustering and variables known to influence risk (i.e., race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, renter status, income inequality, and population density). However, HAP exposures are distributed differently for same-sex male versus same-sex female partner households. Neighborhoods with relatively high proportions of same-sex male partner households are associated with significantly greater exposure to cancer-causing HAPs while those with high proportions of same-sex female partner households are associated with less exposure. This study provides initial empirical documentation of a previously unstudied pattern, and infuses current theoretical understanding of environmental inequality formation with knowledge emanating from the sexualities and space literature.

Results from multivariate generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses show that greater Mormon prevalence and white composition each independently predict lower levels of air pollution; moreover, Mormon prevalence and whiteness are the strongest predictors in the models. Results also demonstrate that greater proportions of Hispanic, black, and Pacific Islander residents predict higher levels of air pollution, suggesting that systemic white privilege oppresses those groups such that they experience air pollution disparities. Mormons are socially privileged in Salt Lake City, and findings indicate that their collective power serves to protect them from air pollution. Exploratory GEE interaction analyses reveal that disparities in exposure to particulate matter based on higher Hispanic composition are attenuated under conditions of high Mormon prevalence.

We employ an intersectional cross-classificatory approach to analyze the distribution of heat exposure between sociodemographic categories split into age groups in the contiguous US. We utilize high-resolution daily air temperature data to establish three census tract-level heat metrics (i.e., average summer temperature, heat waves, and heat island days). We pair those metrics with American Community Survey estimates on racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and disability status by age to calculate population weighted mean exposures and absolute disparity metrics. Our findings indicate few substantive differences between age groups overall, but more substantial differences between sociodemographic categories within age groups, with children and older adults from socially marginalized backgrounds facing greater exposure than adults from similar backgrounds. When looking at sociodemographic differences by age, people of color of any age and older adults without health insurance emerge as the most exposed groups.

Paradoxical Multilevel Effects of Poverty on Hispanic Children’s Wheezing,"Prior research suggests that economic deprivation has a generally negative influence on residents’ health. We employ hierarchical logistic regression modeling to test if economic deprivation presents respiratory health risks or benefits to Hispanic children living in the City of El Paso (Texas, USA) at neighborhood- and individual-levels, and whether individual-level health effects of economic deprivation vary based on neighborhood-level economic deprivation. Data come from the US Census Bureau and a population-based survey of El Paso schoolchildren. The dependent variable is children’s current wheezing, an established respiratory morbidity measure, which is appropriate for use with economically-deprived children with an increased likelihood of not receiving a doctor’s asthma diagnosis. Results reveal that economic deprivation (measured based on poverty status) at both neighborhood- and individual-levels is associated with reduced odds of wheezing for Hispanic children. A sensitivity analysis revealed similar significant effects of individual- and neighborhood-level poverty on the odds of doctor-diagnosed asthma. Neighborhood-level poverty did not significantly modify the observed association between individual-level poverty and Hispanic children’s wheezing; however, greater neighborhood poverty tends to be more protective for poor (as opposed to non-poor) Hispanic children. These findings support a novel, multilevel understanding of seemingly paradoxical effects of economic deprivation on Hispanic health.",2014,2014-08-06,4,Timothy W. Collins; Young-An Kim; Sara E.

The H-1B visa program, for example, is a firm-sponsored entry where firms are responsible for every stage: from identifying the immigrant, to employing them, to filing for permanent residency on behalf of the immigrant. This central role of firms for high-skilled immigration suggests the traditional lens for evaluating the impact of immigration on natives through local area labor markets or national age-education approaches may miss important dynamics. We analyze the employment and wage trajectories of high-skilled workers born in America when a high-skilled immigrant arrives at their work site. We use linked employer-employee data during the 1995-2008 period from the Census Bureau for this exercise, which identifies the immigration status and country-of-birth of workers. We follow the subsequent career path of workers after high-skilled immigration occurs to the employee's work site both within firms (e.g., changes in employee salary, relocation to other sites) and across firms (e.g., movements to new jobs or out of workforce, long-term salary adjustments). The richness and depth of the Census Bureau data allow for multiple comparison points: selection on observables (e.g., age, tenure, salary levels and recent growth), varying immigration treatments across different work sites for the same firm for otherwise comparable employees, and (for a subset of cases and short time period at the end of our sample) randomization in H-1B admission lotteries.",2013,2013-05-01,34,Sari Pekkala Kerr; William R.

This methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), which is an ongoing survey administered by the US Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. The ACS has published 1‐year, 3‐year, and 5‐year period estimates, and margins of errors, for demographic and socio‐economic variables recorded over predefined geographies. The spatio‐temporal COS methodology considered here provides data users with a way to estimate ACS variables on customized geographies and time periods while accounting for sampling errors. Additionally, 3‐year ACS period estimates are to be discontinued, and this methodology can provide predictions of ACS variables for 3‐year periods given the available period estimates. The methodology is based on a spatio‐temporal mixed‐effects model with a low‐dimensional spatio‐temporal basis function representation, which provides multi‐resolution estimates through basis function aggregation in space and time. This methodology includes a novel parameterization that uses a target dynamical process and recently proposed parsimonious Moran's I propagator structures. Our approach is demonstrated through two applications using public‐use ACS estimates and is shown to produce good predictions on a hold‐out set of 3‐year period estimates.

Not all surveys produce the same information, and thus, combining these surveys typically leads to higher quality estimates. That is, not every survey has the same level of precision nor do they always provide estimates of the same variables. In addition, various surveys often produce estimates with incomplete spatio‐temporal coverage. By combining surveys using a Bayesian approach, we can account for different margins of error and leverage dependencies to produce estimates of every variable considered at every spatial location and every time point. Specifically, our strategy is to use a hierarchical modelling approach, where the first stage of the model incorporates the margin of error associated with each survey. Then, in a lower stage of the hierarchical model, the multivariate spatio‐temporal mixed effects model is used to incorporate multivariate spatio‐temporal dependencies of the processes of interest. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach for combining surveys; that is, given all of the available surveys, the conditional distributions of the latent processes of interest are used for statistical inference. To demonstrate our proposed methodology, we jointly analyze period estimates from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, and estimates obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics program.

We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By ‘regionalization’ we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error, which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define the criterion we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen–Loève expansion. This relationship between the criterion for spatial aggregation error and the multiscale Karhunen–Loève expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance and a novel extension of Obled–Creutin eigenfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through an analysis of two data sets: one using the American Community Survey and one related to environmental ocean winds.",2016,2016-05-10,48,Jonathan R.

In the context of small area estimation, these estimates can be further improved by borrowing strength across spatial regions or by considering multiple outcomes simultaneously. We provide here two formulations to perform small area estimation with Fay–Herriot models that include both multivariate outcomes and latent spatial dependence. We consider two model formulations. In one of these formulations the outcome‐by‐space dependence structure is separable. The other accounts for the cross dependence through the use of a generalized multivariate conditional autoregressive (GMCAR) structure. The GMCAR model is shown, in a state‐level example, to produce smaller mean square prediction errors, relative to equivalent census variables, than the separable model and the state‐of‐the‐art multivariate model with unstructured dependence between outcomes and no spatial dependence. In addition, both the GMCAR and the separable models give smaller mean squared prediction error than the state‐of‐the‐art model when conducting small area estimation on county level data from the American Community Survey.",2015,2015-02-22,46,Aaron T.

We also introduce the use of the conditional multivariate logit‐beta distribution into the dependent multinomial data setting, which leads to conjugate full‐conditional distributions for use in a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We refer to this model as the multinomial spatio‐temporal mixed effects model (MN‐STM).

A causal link has been hypothesized between income inequality and income segregation, which measures how much households with similar incomes cluster. The information theory index is used to measure income segregation, however, critics have suggested the divergence index instead. Motivated by this, we construct both indices using American Community Survey (ACS) estimates of features of the income distribution. Since the elimination of the decennial census long form, methods of computing these indices must be updated to interpolate ACS estimates and account for survey error. We propose a novel model-based method to do this which improves on previous approaches by using more types of estimates, and by providing uncertainty quantification. We apply this method to estimate U.S. census tract-level income distributions, and in turn use these to construct both income segregation indices. We find major differences between the two indices and find evidence that the information index underestimates the relationship between income inequality and income segregation. The literature suggests interventions designed to reduce income inequality by reducing income segregation, or vice versa, so using the information index implicitly understates the value of these interventions.

Despite the availability of these predefined geographies it is often of interest to data users to specify customized user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate demographic variables defined on ""new"" spatial supports in ""real-time."" This problem is known as spatial change of support (COS), which is typically performed under the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally, survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an aggregation of events from a spatial point process.

To achieve these goals, preselected locations are sampled during scheduled visits, in which the number of species observed at each location is recorded. This results in spatially referenced replicated count data that are often unbalanced in structure and exhibit overdispersion. Motivated by the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, we propose Bayesian hierarchical binomial mixture models, including Binomial Conway–Maxwell Poisson (Bin-CMP) mixture models, that formally account for varying levels of spatial dispersion.

Our primary interest is when there are possibly millions of data points referenced over different variables, geographic regions, and times. This problem requires extensive methodological advancements, as jointly modeling correlated data of this size leads to the so-called ""big n problem."" The computational complexity of prediction in this setting is further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, we develop a new computationally efficient distribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce a multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial theoretical development including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. The results in this manuscript are extremely general, and can be used for data that exhibit fewer sources of dependency than what we consider (e.g., multivariate, spatial-only, or spatio-temporal-only data). Hence, the implications of our modeling framework may have a large impact on the general problem of jointly modeling correlated count-valued data.

We provide here two formulations to perform small area estimation with Fay-Herriot models that include both multivariate outcomes and latent spatial dependence.

Spatio-temporal statistics has been developing at a rapid pace over the past 25 years. The topic is briefly covered in Cressie's (1993) comprehensive book on spatial statistics. Subsequently, Cressie and Wikle (2011) provided the first comprehensive book on spatio-temporal statistics, but it focused primarily on linear, univariate, and Gaussian methods. More recently, there have been numerous significant advancements in non-linear, multivariate, and non-Gaussian spatio-temporal methods, particularly those suited for ‘big’ data problems. Yet, each of these topic areas is relatively underdeveloped, and there are still many research challenges. Historically, spatio-temporal statistics methodology has developed more as an extension of spatial statistics rather than time series. That is, the emphasis has been on specification of models through their second-order structure, typically within a Gaussian process framework. Alternatively, dynamic spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) have been used to model processes for which it is more realistic to think of spatial processes evolving through time, that is, when it is more reasonable to think of the process conditionally (in time) rather than marginally (as with the Gaussian process framework). DSTMs often have model forms as in classical multivariate time series models, but they present unique challenges in that the types of relationships between space and time are often driven by mechanistic processes, and the associated statistical models must attempt to accommodate these relationships. In addition, the dimensionality of the spatial components of these models often prohibits the use of classical multivariate time series methods. Although much of the development of spatio-temporal methodology has been driven by environmental, epidemiological, and ecological applications (e.g. pollution monitoring, weather forecasting, climate, oceanography, disease mapping, invasive species, animal movement, etc.), there is an increasing number of novel methodologies that are motivated by the biological sciences (e.g. brain science), federal statistics (e.g. multivariate surveys, non-Gaussian change of support), sociological statistics (e.g. crime analysis), and econometric (e.g. multivariate panel) applications. Indeed, these processes are often multivariate, non-linear, and/or non-Gaussian. The articles in this special issue provide a representative snapshot of innovative work in these areas. Specifically, the articles selected for this issue highlight non-Gaussian spatio-temporal models, computational efficiency, and/or improving parameterizations of DSTMs. In their article ‘Scalable Inference for Space-Time Gaussian Cox Processes’, Shirota and Banerjee show how one can use an efficient data augmentation approach in conjunction with nearest-neighbor log-Gaussian processes to efficiently model count (crime event) data via spatio-temporal Gaussian Cox processes. In ‘Estimating Spatial Changes Over Time of Artic Sea Ice Using Hidden 2 × 2 Tables’, Zhang and Cressie consider non-Gaussian (Bernoulli) data on the presence/absence of sea ice. The model is cast in an efficient manner by using dimension-reduced spatio-temporal processes in an EM algorithm, cleverly describing the process as time-varying 2 × 2 tables. Tagle, Castruccio, Crippa, and Genton, in their article ‘A Non-Gaussian Spatio-Temporal Model for Daily Wind Speeds Based on a Multivariate Skew-T Distribution’, show how to build an efficient and realistic ‘weather generator’ for daily wind speeds that is able to simulate the type of skewed distributions that are often found in weather variables. In their article ‘On a Semiparametric Data-Driven Nonlinear Model with Penalized Spatio-Temporal Lag Interactions’, Al-Sulami, Jiang, Lu, and Zhu consider a non-linear (semiparametric) regression spatio-temporal model that also includes a dynamic interaction term and consider an adaptive lasso approach for selecting the space–time lag interactions that are most useful (in their example, to model US housing price data). Their methodology does not rely on a Gaussian error assumption. In the spirit of efficient modeling of the spatio-temporal terms beyond a trend and seasonality, Gao and Tsay present an efficient structured factor approach for multivariate time series and spatio-temporal data (e.g. PM2.5 pollutant observations) in their article ‘A Structural-Factor Approach to Modeling High-Dimensional Time Series and Space-Time Data’. Finally, in their article ‘Spatio-Temporal Models for Big Multinomial Data Using the Conditional Multivariate Logit-Beta Distribution’, Bradley, Wikle and Holan develop a novel efficient conjugate Bayesian algorithm to model high-dimensional spatio-temporal multinomial data, which includes a spatio-temporal dynamic process. They apply this model to public-use Quarterly Workforce Indicators from the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics program of the US Census Bureau. These articles provide excellent examples of how spatio-temporal statistical models can be applied to address complex non-Gaussian, non-linear, and multivariate data with efficient computational algorithms. These problems are by no means ‘solved’, but it is our hope that the readers of the Journal of Time Series Analysis may see connections to their own work that can be applied to this rich set of problems and this growing and important area of statistics.

After attending high school in Lyndon, Kentucky, he earned a B.S. (1962) and M.A. (1963) in mathematics from the University of Cincinnati. He then lived in Germany, studying functional analysis under Gottfried Köthe, obtaining a Ph.D. from the University of Frankfurt in 1967. Returning to the United States, he served as a mathematics professor at the University of Cincinnati until 1975. Having transitioned from pure mathematics to statistical time series analysis, Findley took a new academic position at the University of Tulsa, during which time he interacted frequently with the nearby research laboratories of major oil companies and consulted regularly for Cities Service Oil Company (now Citgo). In 1980 he was invited to lead the seasonal adjustment research effort at the U.S. Census Bureau, and eventually rose to be a Senior Mathematical Statistician before his retirement in 2009. In 1966 he married Mary Virginia Baker, and they currently live in Washington, DC. David Findley has published more than 40 journal articles and book chapters, as well as dozens of technical reports and conference proceedings, many of which are heavily cited and influential. He has also published two edited volumes (1978 and 1981) that have had a substantial impact on the field of time series analysis. Numerous honors and awards have accrued to him, including ASA Fellow (1987), the Julius Shiskin award (1996) and the U.S. Department of Commerce Gold Medal (1997).",2012,2012-11-01,0,Tucker McElroy; Scott H.

The first phase of the survey was quickly launched one month after the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and ran for 12 weeks. To track the immediate impact of the pandemic, individual respondents during this phase were re-sampled for up to three consecutive weeks. Motivated by expected job loss during the pandemic, using public-use microdata, this work proposes unit-level, model-based estimators that incorporate longitudinal dependence at both the response and domain level. In particular, using a pseudo-likelihood, we consider a Bayesian hierarchical unit-level, model-based approach for both Gaussian and binary response data under informative sampling. To facilitate construction of these model-based estimates, we develop an efficient Gibbs sampler. An empirical simulation study is conducted to compare the proposed approach to models that do not account for unit-level longitudinal correlation. Finally, using public-use HPS micro-data, we provide an analysis of ""expected job loss"" that compares both design-based and model-based estimators and demonstrates superior performance for the proposed model-based approaches.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Daniel Vedensky; Paul A.

The inclusion of these functional covariates is facilitated through a two-stage dimension-reduction approach that includes a Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion followed by stochastic search variable selection. Additionally, the importance of modeling spatial autocorrelation has recently been recognized in the FH model; our model utilizes the intrinsic conditional autoregressive class of spatial models in addition to functional covariates.

We investigate how these forms of spatial aggregation error can guide a regionalization over a spatial domain of interest. By ""regionalization"" we mean a specification of geographies that define the spatial support for areal data. This topic has been studied vigorously by geographers, but has been given less attention by spatial statisticians. Thus, we propose a criterion for spatial aggregation error (CAGE), which we minimize to obtain an optimal regionalization. To define CAGE we draw a connection between spatial aggregation error and a new multiscale representation of the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion. This relationship between CAGE and the multiscale K-L expansion leads to illuminating theoretical developments including: connections between spatial aggregation error, squared prediction error, spatial variance, and a novel extension of Obled-Creutin eigenfunctions.

But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS. Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas. Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories. Thirteen variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability; and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability. Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI. The NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects of heat in vulnerable areas.",2017,2017-12-01,178,Seema G.

These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random errors average to zero. This means that although single variables can be methodologically problematic at the census tract scale, a large collection of such variables provides utility as a contextual descriptor of the place(s) under investigation. This idea is demonstrated by developing a geodemographic typology of all U.S. census tracts. The typology is firmly rooted in the social scientific literature and is organized around a framework of concepts, domains, and measures. The typology is validated using public domain data from the City of Chicago and the U.S. Federal Election Commission. The typology, as well as the data and methods used to create it, is open source and published freely online.",2015,2015-08-18,77,Seth Spielman; Alex Singleton,University of Colorado Boulder; University of Liverpool,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urban Transport and Accessibility; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis",Annals of the Association of American Geographers,08,"Spielman, Seth; Singleton, Alex. 2015.

We develop a novel approach to model social vulnerability that couples individuals and their varying forms of protective capacity with the social fabric of the communities in which they reside. The backbone of our model is the Public-Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), a product of the U.S. Census Bureau that preserves a representative sample of completed responses to the American Community Survey (ACS). The PUMS enables us to understand the full range of individual protective capacities against a hazard in an exposed area, which we term individual vulnerability profiles (IVPs). In this case, we examine IVPs in the Coney Island–Brighton Beach section of New York City, which suffered severe impacts during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. To manage the large number of unique IVPs in Coney Island–Brighton Beach, we perform a segmentation analysis to generalize them into thematic cohort vulnerability profiles (CVPs) representing a typology of vulnerable people in Coney Island–Brighton Beach during Sandy. From synthetic populations of CVPs, we then estimate how individuals in varying housing types were coexposed to Sandy at the census tract level by classifying these areas into community social vulnerability profiles (SVPs). Our results provide a topology of social vulnerability that simultaneously links individual, community, and population-wide concerns, enabling a more holistic understanding of resources and interventions beneficial to human security during events like Sandy than is attainable with area-level metrics.",2022,2022-01-24,18,Joseph Tuccillo; Seth Spielman,National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Colorado Boulder,"Disaster Management and Resilience; Flood Risk Assessment and Management; Climate Change, Adaptation, Migration",Annals of the American Association of Geographers,01,"Tuccillo, Joseph; Spielman, Seth. 2022.

In this paper, we present a solution to this problem in the form of an AI based open and reproducible geodemographic classification system for the United States using small area estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS). We employ a partitioning clustering algorithm to a range of socio-economic, demographic, and built environment variables. Our approach utilizes an open source software pipeline that ensures adaptability to future data updates. A key innovation is the integration of GPT4, a state-of-the-art large language model, to generate intuitive cluster descriptions and names.

An Empirical Test of Efficiency Wages Based on Urban Economic Theory,"Recent theoretical work has examined the spatial distribution of unemployment using the efficiency wage model as the mechanism by which unemployment arises in the urban economy. This paper extends the standard efficiency wage model in order to allow for behavioral substitution between leisure time at home and effort at work. In equilibrium, residing at a location with a long commute affects the time available for leisure at home and therefore affects the trade-off between effort at work and risk of unemployment. This model implies an empirical relationship between expected commutes and labor market outcomes, which is tested using the Public Use Microdata sample of the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census. The empirical results suggest that efficiency wages operate primarily for blue collar workers, i.e. workers who tend to be in occupations that face higher levels of supervision. For this subset of workers, longer commutes imply higher levels of unemployment and higher wages, which are both consistent with shirking and leisure being substitutable.",2007,2007-01-01,3,Stephen L.

We present the feasibility of geocoding a nationwide occupational cohort, the US Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT, N=146,021) to: (1) evaluate geocoding across time, (2) test precision of geocoding by rural (vs. urban) status and by neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), and (3) explore nSES distribution by some cohort demographic factors. We created a standardized nSES index, based on validated methods, for each census block-group in the US, at 3 time points, using 6 items from the U.S. Census (1990, 2000) and American Community Survey (2010): regionally-adjusted median household income and median housing value, % households with interest/income, % adults who completed high school, % adults who completed college, and % employed persons in managerial occupations. To link nSES to the cohort, we geocoded respondent addresses in 1992, 2003, 2010, to block-group of residence. Over 99% of addresses were geocoded; 76 to 86% were mapped to an address-specific block-group, while the rest were geocoded to a block-group of the zipcode centroid. Urban (vs. rural) addresses and those in the highest (vs. lowest) nSES quintile were more likely to be geocoded to an address-specific block-group (OR=4.6; 95%CI=4.5-4.7 and OR=6.4; 95%CI=6.1-6.7, respectively for 1992 addresses). Results of linear regression show higher nSES in 1990 was associated with USRT participants of female gender (β=0.22; 95%CI=0.20, 0.23), older age (β=0.003; 95%CI=0.002, 0.003), white race (β=0.37; 95%CI=0.35, 0.38) and more recent age-adjusted certification year (β= -0.018; 95%CI= -0.016, -0.019).

No studies have explored whether and to what extent individual-level socioeconomic factors account for the relation between neighborhood disadvantage and cognitive decline. The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP) on cognitive decline and examine how individual-level SEP factors (educational level, annual income, and occupation) influenced neighborhood associations over the course of 10 years. Participants (n = 1,789) were community-dwelling older Mexican Americans from the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. Neighborhood SEP was derived by linking the participant's individual data to the 2000 decennial census. The authors assessed cognitive function with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination. Analyses used 3-level hierarchical linear mixed models of time within individuals within neighborhoods. After adjustment for individual-level sociodemographic characteristics, higher neighborhood SEP was significantly associated with cognitive function (β = −0.033; P < 0.05) and rates of decline (β = −0.0009; P < 0.10). After adjustment for individual educational level, neighborhood SEP remained associated with baseline cognition but not with rates of decline. Differences in individual educational levels explained most of the intra- and interneighborhood variance.

We apply the protocol to examine whether diversity in ownership teams increases or decreases the likelihood of a firm reporting a novel innovation using data from the 2018 United States Census Bureau’s Annual Business Survey. Transparency is increased in three ways: 1) all specification testing and identifying potentially productive models is done in an exploratory subsample that 2) preserves the validity of hypothesis test statistics from de novo estimation in the holdout confirmatory sample with 3) all findings publicly documented in an earlier registered report and in this journal publication. Bayesian estimation procedures that leverage information from the exploratory stage included in the confirmatory stage estimation replace traditional frequentist null hypothesis significance testing. In addition to increasing statistical power by using information from the full sample, Bayesian methods directly estimate a probability distribution for the magnitude of an effect, allowing much richer inference. Estimated magnitudes of diversity along academic discipline, race, ethnicity, and foreign-born status dimensions are positively associated with innovation.

While focusing on two structural constraints, organizational and spatial factors, I build off of the fact that in the past thirty years in the U.S. beer industry, as the number of beer producers (i.e. brewers) proliferated, their intermediaries (i.e. wholesalers) declined. Using establishment-level restricted-access economic microdata from the Longitudinal Business Database and the Census of Wholesale Trade, I examine what happens with the intermediaries when (some) producers start competing on product variety instead of competing on scale. I find that Stinchcombe’s ‘liability of newness’ principle can get suspended and certain newcomers have better survival chances than industry incumbents. That is, entrepreneurial establishments fare better if they are part of well-resourced multiunit firms and are entering the market in an area where a large proportion of establishments exited previously.

Unionized plants do not exhibit the same positive associations between incentives and investment and growth found in non-unionized plants. This effect holds among both non-managerial and managerial employees, although it has a more pronounced influence on the former group. Consequently, unionized plants experience higher rates of closure, reduced investment, and slower employment growth. We also find significant spillover effects within the firm: partially unionized firms not only offer higher wages but also maintain weaker incentives in their non-unionized plants compared to their industry peers. These effects are economically significant and are half of our estimated reduction in incentives in unionized plants. This pattern aligns with the hypothesis that incentives in non-unionized plants create disutility for the median worker. Spillovers reduce employment and efficiency and make firms less attractive as potential targets, thus reducing the market’s effectiveness in allocating corporate assets.

This volumes main objective is to interpret the redistribution patterns of the 1970s and early 1980s in light of the changing social and economic contexts for redistribution that emerged during this period taking cognizance of the major explanations and theories that have been offered to account for these new patterns. Part 1 comprising chapters 3-6 pertains to redistribution across regions and metropolitan areas. This portion of the monograph provides an overview of the new regional and metropolitan area redistribution patterns by evaluating the pervasiveness of the post-1970 redistribution reversals as well as shifts in the demographic components of change that underlie them. It examines the impact of 1970-1980 growth and decline on population and household subgroups in various areas and undertakes a separate examination of redistribution patterns determinants and consequences for the black population. Part 2 of this monograph comprising chapters 7-11 evaluates post-1970 shifts in central city-suburban redistribution within the nations 39 largest metropolitan areas. It also documents aggregate population changes for central cities and suburbs along with their underlying demographic components. It devotes the most attention to shifts in the racial and socioeconomic selectivities that have become associated with post-1970 suburbanization and their impacts on the central city. It provides careful evaluation of selective post-1970 city-suburb redistribution tendencies with the aid of rich area-based summary data from the 1970 and 1980 decennial censuses. It evaluates the extent to which the 1970s shifts in racial segregation the decline of full-family households and the rise of the so-called service city have effected beneficial demographic changes in large central cities. The final chapter ties together this studys major results and underlying perspectives. It reviews the most important influences on redistribution in the post-1970 period and speculates about future redistribution tendencies that could emerge.,1989,1989-01-01,126,William A. V.

Prior research has demonstrated that public firms invest less than private firms and suggests this difference in investment behavior is due to ‘short-termism’ - pressure from capital markets to strongly favor short over long term earnings. We extend this logic to other firm behavior, examining whether publicly owned plants invest in energy efficiency and pollution reduction differently than privately owned plants. Using data from the US Census of Manufactures from 1980-2009, linked with information on pollution from the EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and pollution abatement spending from the PACE survey, we find some evidence that publicly owned plants are less energy efficient, release more toxic emissions and spend less on pollution abatement than their privately owned counterparts. We also examine how different sources of external pressures alter these results and find that increased regulatory scrutiny is correlated with increased energy efficiency, toxic emissions and abatement spending. More concentrated institutional ownership in public firms is associated with lower energy efficiency as is a greater brand focus. These latter results are broadly consistent with the idea that publicly owned firms respond to pressures from capital markets with a reduced focus on environmentally relevant variables.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Rachelle C.

First, the paper provides a theoretical model which shows that greater local demand for a given input promotes the entry of suppliers into a city; the increased number of suppliers then results in lower outsourcing prices and a higher use of outsourcing by final producers, therefore reducing the final producers' production costs. I then test the predictions of the model by examining manufacturing plants' practices of outsourcing business services, by using plant-level data from the 1992 Annual Survey of Manufactures. The empirical results show that an exogenous increase in local demand promotes the entry of service suppliers and increases a firm's probability of outsourcing for white-collar services. In particular, I found that doubling the intensity of the use of a service in a U.S. county, which can be attributed to the industrial composition of the county, results in a 7% to 25% increase in the probability of outsourcing.",2001,2001-01-01,32,Yukako Ono,Federal Reserve,Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Global trade and economics; Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Ono, Yukako. 2001.

It is therefore surprising that young men are evaluated for testosterone deficiency with the same cutoff of 300 ng/dL that was developed from samples of older men. Our aim is to describe normative total testosterone levels and age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels in men 20 to 44 years old. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which survey nationally representative samples of United States residents. Men 20 to 44 years old with testosterone levels were included. Men on hormonal medications, with a history of testicular cancer or orchiectomy, and with afternoon/evening laboratory values were excluded. We separated men into 5-year intervals and evaluated the testosterone levels of each age group, and for all men 20 to 44 years old. We used the American Urological Association definition of a “normal testosterone level” (the “middle tertile”) to calculate age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels. Results: Our final analytic cohort contained 1,486 men. Age-specific middle tertile levels were 409-558 ng/dL (20-24 years old), 413-575 ng/dL (25-29 years old), 359-498 ng/dL (30-34 years old), 352-478 ng/dL (35-39 years old), and 350-473 ng/dL (40-44 years old). Age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone levels were 409, 413, 359, 352, and 350 ng/dL, respectively. Conclusions: Diagnosis of testosterone deficiency has traditionally been performed in an age-indiscriminate manner. However, young men have different testosterone reference ranges than older men. Accordingly, age-specific normative values and cutoffs should be integrated into the evaluation of young men presenting with testosterone deficiency. References 1. . Male hypogonadism.

This study highlights the importance of considering physical barriers--features of the urban environment that disconnect locations--when measuring segregation. We use population and geographic data for 20 U.S. Rustbelt cities from the 2010 decennial census and a novel approach for measuring and analyzing segregation that incorporates the connectivity of roads and the excess distance imposed by physical barriers, such as highways, railroad tracks, and dead-end streets. We find that physical barriers divide urban space in ways that reinforce or exacerbate segregation, but there is substantial variation in the extent to which they increase segregation both within and across these cities and for different ethnoracial groups. By uncovering a new source of variation in the segregation experienced by city residents, the findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of segregation and the consequences of segregation.",2015,2015-01-01,7,Elizabeth Roberto; Jackelyn Hwang,,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urban Transport and Accessibility; Urbanization and City Planning",arXiv (Cornell University),01,"Roberto, Elizabeth; Hwang, Jackelyn. 2015.

While the regression analysis crucially depends on the price that consumers face, the post-tariff price of imported meat depends not only on ad valorem duties but also on tariff rate quotas and gate price system regimes. The effective tariff rate is consequently evaluated by utilizing monthly transaction data. To address potential endogeneity problems, we apply exchange rates that we believe to be independent of the demand shocks for imported meat.

Since these programs operate under resource constraints, they must decide who to prioritize. Typically, funding is distributed by a reactive allocation process that does not systematically consider risk of future homelessness. We partnered with Anonymous County (PA) to explore a proactive and preventative allocation approach that prioritizes individuals facing eviction based on their risk of future homelessness. Our ML models, trained on state and county administrative data accurately identify at-risk individuals, outperforming simpler prioritization approaches by at least 20% while meeting our equity and fairness goals across race and gender. Furthermore, our approach would reach 28% of individuals who are overlooked by the current process and end up homeless.

Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer‐Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure files, we produce a uniform set of earnings statistics for the U.S. From 1998 to 2019, we find U.S. earnings inequality has increased and volatility has decreased. The combination of increased inequality and reduced volatility suggest earnings growth differs substantially across different demographic groups. We explore this further by estimating 12‐year average earnings for a single cohort of age 25–54 eligible workers. Overall, differences in labor supply (hours paid and quarters worked) are found to explain almost 90% of the variation in worker earnings at the mean, although substantial earnings differences across and within groups remain unexplained. Using a quantile regression approach, we estimate counterfactual earnings distributions for each demographic group. We find that at the bottom of the earnings distribution differences in characteristics such as hours paid, geographic division, industry, and education explain almost the entire earnings gap; however, above the median the contribution of the differences in the returns to characteristics is the dominant component.",2022,2022-01-01,16,Kevin L.

Since many crimes are never reported to law enforcement, estimates based on police records alone must be adjusted to account for the likelihood that each crime would have been reported to the police. In this paper we present a methodological framework for estimating the likelihood of arrest from police data that incorporates estimates of crime reporting rates computed from a victimization survey. We propose a parametric regression-based two-step estimator that: (i) estimates the likelihood of crime reporting using logistic regression with survey weights and then (ii) applies a second regression step to model the likelihood of arrest. Our empirical analysis focuses on racial disparities in arrests for violent crimes (sex offenses, robbery, aggravated and simple assaults) from 2006–2015 police records from the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS), with estimates of crime reporting obtained using 2003–2020 data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). We find that, after adjusting for unreported crimes, the likelihood of arrest computed from police records decreases significantly. We also find that, while incidents with white offenders, on average, result in arrests more often than those with black offenders, the disparities tend to be small after accounting for crime characteristics and unreported crimes.",2024,2024-04-05,0,Riccardo Fogliato; Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla; Zachary C.

There is evidence that bias in estimating the crime rates from survey data may arise because some women respondents are “gagged” in reporting some types of crimes by the use of a telephone rather than a personal interview, and by the presence of a spouse during the interview. On the other hand, as data on these crimes are collected every year, it would be more efficient in data analysis if we could identify and make use of information from previous data. In this paper we propose a model to adjust the estimates of the rates of rape and domestic violence to account for the response bias due to the “gag” factors. To estimate parameters in the model, we identify the information that is not sensitive to time and incorporate this into prior distributions. The strength of Bayesian estimators is their ability to combine information from long observational records in a sensible way. Within a Bayesian framework, we develop an Expectation-Maximization-Bayesian (EMB) algorithm for computation in analyzing contingency table and we apply the jackknife to estimate the accuracy of the estimates. Our approach is illustrated using the yearly crime data from the National Crime Victimization Survey. The illustration shows that compared with the classical method, our model leads to more efficient estimation but does not require more complicated computation.",2008,2008-06-01,10,Qingzhao Yu; Elizabeth A.

In the United States, small area estimates of population counts are published by the United States Census Bureau (USCB) in the form of the Decennial census counts, Intercensal population projections (PEP), and American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. Although there are significant relationships between these data sources, there are important contrasts in data collection and processing methodologies, such that each set of estimates may be subject to different sources and magnitudes of error. Additionally, these data sources do not report identical small area population counts due to post-survey adjustments specific to each data source. Resulting small area disease/mortality rates may differ depending on which data source is used for population counts (denominator data). To accurately capture annual small area population counts, and associated uncertainties, we present a Bayesian population model (B-Pop), which fuses information from all three USCB sources, accounting for data source specific methodologies and associated errors. The main features of our framework are: 1) a single model integrating multiple data sources, 2) accounting for data source specific data generating mechanisms, and specifically accounting for data source specific errors, and 3) prediction of estimates for years without USCB reported data.

This study utilized large-scale social media data to study different crisis activity concerns (i.e., evacuation, staying indoors, shopping, and recreational activities among others) in the emergence of the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke in NYC. In this regard, one week (June 02 through June 09, 2023) geotagged Twitter data from NYC were retrieved and used in the analysis. The tweets were processed using advanced text classification techniques and later integrated with national databases such as Social Security Administration data, Census, and American Community Survey. Finally, a model has been developed to make community inferences of different activity concerns in a major wildfire. The findings suggest, during wildfires, females are less likely to engage in discussions about evacuation, trips for medical, social, or recreational purposes, and commuting for work, likely influenced by workplaces maintaining operations despite poor air quality. There were also racial disparities in these discussions, with Asians being more likely than Hispanics to discuss evacuation and work commute, and African Americans being less likely to discuss social and recreational activities. Additionally, individuals from low-income neighborhoods and non-higher education students expressed fewer concerns about evacuation. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, emergency planners, and public health officials, aiding them in formulating targeted communication strategies and equitable emergency response plans.",2024,2024-01-22,0,Khondhaker Al Momin; Md Sami Hasnine; Arif Mohaimin Sadri,,Disaster Management and Resilience,arXiv (Cornell University),01,"Momin, Khondhaker Al; Hasnine, Md Sami; Sadri, Arif Mohaimin. 2024.

Incorporating information from the full 2020 Decennial Census and data on publications, we find that about half of those induced into nonemployment appear to permanently leave the US and are 90% less likely to publish in a given year, with even larger impacts for trainees (postdocs and graduate students). Among personnel who continue to work in the US, we find that interrupted personnel earn 20% less than their continuously-funded peers, with the largest declines concentrated among trainees and other non-faculty personnel (such as staff and undergraduates).

In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau subsequently posed an open question: Could sharper privacy guarantees be obtained for the 2020 U.S. Census compared to their published guarantees, or equivalently, had the nominal privacy budgets been fully utilized? In this paper, we affirmatively address this open problem by demonstrating that between 8.50% and 13.76% of the privacy budget for the 2020 U.S. Census remains unused for each of the eight geographical levels, from the national level down to the block level. This finding is made possible through our precise tracking of privacy losses using $f$-differential privacy, applied to the composition of private queries across various geographical levels. Our analysis indicates that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of injected noise to achieve the claimed privacy guarantee for the 2020 U.S. Census. Consequently, our results enable the Bureau to reduce noise variances by 15.08% to 24.82% while maintaining the same privacy budget for each geographical level, thereby enhancing the accuracy of privatized census statistics. We empirically demonstrate that reducing noise injection into census statistics mitigates distortion caused by privacy constraints in downstream applications of private census data, illustrated through a study examining the relationship between earnings and education.",2024,2024-10-11,0,Buxin Su; Weijie Su; Chendi Wang,,Census and Population Estimation; Primary Care and Health Outcomes; Healthcare Policy and Management,arXiv (Cornell University),10,"Su, Buxin; Su, Weijie; Wang, Chendi. 2024.

The confidentiality of individuals represented “anonymously” in these statistical tables will be protected by a “formal privacy” technique that allows the Bureau to mathematically assess the risk of revealing information about individuals in the released statistical tables. The Bureau’s approach is an implementation of “differential privacy,” and it gives a rigorously demonstrated guaranteed level of privacy protection that traditional methods of disclosure avoidance do not.

Our findings support the use of DP over swapping for single-year-of-age counts; in particular, concerning behaviors associated with DP (namely, poor behavior for smaller districts) occur with swapping mechanisms as well.

No prior research has examined whether sexual minority young adults also benefitted from the dependent coverage mandate despite previous studies showing lower health insurance coverage among sexual minorities. Our estimates from the American Community Survey, using difference-in-differences and event study models, show that men in same-sex couples aged 21–25 experienced a significantly greater increase in the likelihood of having any health insurance after 2010 than older, 27- to 31-year-old men in same-sex couples. This increase is concentrated among employer-sponsored insurance, and it is robust to permutations of periods and age groups. Effects for women in same-sex couples and men in different-sex couples are smaller than the associated effects for men in same-sex couples. These findings confirm the broad effects of expanded dependent coverage and suggest that eliminating the federal dependent mandate could reduce health insurance coverage among young adult sexual minorities in same-sex couples.",2021,2021-09-03,8,Christopher S.

We use the relative levels of interest in musical genres, where a similarity to the host population in musical preferences is treated as evidence of cultural assimilation. Contrary to skeptics of Mexican assimilation, we find significant cultural convergence even among first-generation immigrants, which problematizes their use as assimilative ""benchmarks"" in the literature. Further, 2nd generation Mexican Americans show high cultural convergence vis-à-vis both Anglos and African-Americans, with the exception of those who speak Spanish.

Initially, they used a method known as ""swapping"" (1990-2010). In 2020, they switched to an algorithm called TopDown that ensures a form of Differential Privacy. While the TopDown algorithm has been made public, no implementation of swapping has been released and many details of the deployed swapping methodology deployed have been kept secret. Further, the Bureau has not published (even a synthetic) ""original"" dataset and its swapped version. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the effects of swapping, and to compare these effects to those of other privacy technologies. To address these difficulties we describe and implement a parameterized swapping algorithm based on Census publications, court documents, and informal interviews with Census employees. With this implementation, we characterize the impacts of swapping on a range of statistical quantities of interest. We provide intuition for the types of shifts induced by swapping and compare against those introduced by TopDown. We find that even when swapping and TopDown introduce errors of similar magnitude, the direction in which statistics are biased need not be the same across the two techniques. More broadly, our implementation provides researchers with the tools to analyze and potentially correct for the impacts of disclosure avoidance systems on the quantities they study.",2025,2025-03-13,0,María Ballesteros; Cynthia Dwork; Gary King; Conlan Olson; Manish Raghavan,Harvard University Press; Harvard University Press; Harvard University Press; Columbia University; IIT@MIT,Privacy-Preserving Technologies in Data; Data-Driven Disease Surveillance; Census and Population Estimation,,03,"Ballesteros, María; Dwork, Cynthia; King, Gary; Olson, Conlan; Raghavan, Manish. 2025.

We also design a sequence of baselines for evaluating reconstruction attacks. Our attacks significantly outperform those that are based only on access to a public distribution or population from which the private dataset D was sampled, demonstrating that they are exploiting information in the aggregate statistics Q ( D ) and not simply the overall structure of the distribution. In other words, the queries Q ( D ) are permitting reconstruction of elements of this dataset, not the distribution from which D was drawn.

Evidence from an empirical comparison,"Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular approach for dealing with missing data arising from non-response in sample surveys. Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) is one of the most widely used MI algorithms for multivariate data, but it lacks theoretical foundation and is computationally intensive. Recently, missing data imputation methods based on deep learning models have been developed with encouraging results in small studies. However, there has been limited research on evaluating their performance in realistic settings compared to MICE, particularly in big surveys. We conduct extensive simulation studies based on a subsample of the American Community Survey to compare the repeated sampling properties of four machine learning based MI methods: MICE with classification trees, MICE with random forests, generative adversarial imputation networks, and multiple imputation using denoising autoencoders. We find the deep learning imputation methods are superior to MICE in terms of computational time. However, with the default choice of hyperparameters in the common software packages, MICE with classification trees consistently outperforms, often by a large margin, the deep learning imputation methods in terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage under a range of realistic settings.",2021,2021-01-01,6,Zhenhua Wang; Olanrewaju Akande; Jason Poulos; Fan Li,,Statistical Methods and Bayesian Inference; Survey Methodology and Nonresponse; Bayesian Methods and Mixture Models,arXiv (Cornell University),01,"Wang, Zhenhua; Akande, Olanrewaju; Poulos, Jason; Li, Fan. 2021.

While mobility is driven by individual needs and preferences, the specific choice of venues to visit is usually constrained by the socioeconomic status of people. The complex interplay between people and places they visit, given their personal attributes and homophily leaning, is a key mechanism behind the emergence of socioeconomic stratification patterns ultimately leading to urban segregation at large. Here we investigate mixing patterns of mobility in the twenty largest cities of the United States by coupling individual check-in data from the social location platform Foursquare with census information from the American Community Survey. We find strong signs of stratification indicating that people mostly visit places in their own socioeconomic class, occasionally visiting locations from higher classes. The intensity of this ‘upwards bias’ increases with socioeconomic status and correlates with standard measures of racial residential segregation. Our results suggest an even stronger socioeconomic segregation in individual mobility than one would expect from system-level distributions, shedding further light on uneven mobility mixing patterns in cities.",2022,2022-05-23,9,Rafiazka Millanida Hilman; Gerardo Íñiguez; Màrton Karsai,Central European University; Central European University; Central European University,"Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Urban Transport and Accessibility",EPJ Data Science,05,"Hilman, Rafiazka Millanida; Íñiguez, Gerardo; Karsai, Màrton. 2022.

To that end, the United States spends more than 1 billion dollars a year gathering census data such as race, gender, education, occupation and unemployment rates. Compared to the traditional method of collecting surveys across many years which is costly and labor intensive, data-driven, machine learning-driven approaches are cheaper and faster—with the potential ability to detect trends in close to real time. In this work, we leverage the ubiquity of Google Street View images and develop a computer vision pipeline to predict income, per capita carbon emission, crime rates and other city attributes from a single source of publicly available visual data. We first detect cars in 50 million images across 200 of the largest US cities and train a model to predict demographic attributes using the detected cars. To facilitate our work, we have collected the largest and most challenging fine-grained dataset reported to date consisting of over 2600 classes of cars comprised of images from Google Street View and other web sources, classified by car experts to account for even the most subtle of visual differences. We use this data to construct the largest scale fine-grained detection system reported to date. Our prediction results correlate well with ground truth income data (r=0.82), Massachusetts department of vehicle registration, and sources investigating crime rates, income segregation, per capita carbon emission, and other market research.

However, estimates of these characteristics are often aggregated over space and time in a fashion that diminishes their utility. Take, for example, estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), a multiyear nationwide survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau: estimates for small municipal areas are aggregated over 5-year periods, whereas 1-year estimates are only available for municipal areas with populations >65,000. Researchers may wish to use ACS estimates in studies of population health to characterize neighborhood-level exposures. However, 5-year estimates may not properly characterize temporal changes or align temporally with other data in the study, while the coarse spatial resolution of the 1-year estimates diminishes their utility in characterizing neighborhood exposure. To circumvent this issue, in this paper we propose a modeling framework to disaggregate estimates of proportions derived from sampling surveys, which explicitly accounts for the survey design effect.

However, there are still few studies on the disparity arising from such threats and the extent to which different communities could be exposed to flood-induced pollution dispersion from toxic sites under future sea level rise. To address this gap, this study selects Texas (a U.S. state with a large number of toxic sites and significant flood hazards) as the study area and investigates impacts of flood-induced pollutant dispersion on different communities under current (2018) and future (2050) flood hazard scenarios. The results show, currently, north coastline in Texas bears higher threats and vulnerable communities (i.e., low income, minorities and unemployed) are disproportionally exposed to these threats. In addition, the future sea-level rise and the exacerbated flood hazards will put additional threats on more (about 10%) Texas residents, among which vulnerable communities will still be disproportionately exposed to the increased threats. Our study reveals the facts that potential coastal pollutant dispersion will further aggravate the environmental injustice issues at the intersection of toxic sites and flood hazards for vulnerable populations and exacerbate risk inequalities.

To do so, I use the American Community Survey data on household composition to infer sexual orientation and combine this with a unique panel dataset on local anti-discrimination laws. Using variation in law implementation across localities over time, I find that anti-discrimination laws significantly reduce gaps in labor force participation rate, employment, and the wage gap for gay men relative to straight men. These laws also significantly reduce the labor force participation rate, employment, and wage premium for lesbian women relative to straight women. One explanation for the reduced labor supply and wage premium is that lesbian couples begin to have more children in response to the laws, shifting to a more traditional household with one woman working fewer hours. Finally, I present evidence that state anti-discrimination laws significantly and persistently increased support for same-sex marriage.

While many are interested in studying the impacts of disclosure avoidance methods on downstream analyses, particularly with the introduction of differential privacy in the 2020 Decennial Census, these efforts are limited by a critical lack of data: The underlying ""microdata,"" which serve as necessary input to disclosure avoidance methods, are kept confidential. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by providing tools to generate synthetic microdata solely from published Census statistics, which can then be used as input to any number of disclosure avoidance algorithms for the sake of evaluation and carrying out comparisons. We define a principled distribution over microdata given published Census statistics and design algorithms to sample from this distribution. We formulate synthetic data generation in this context as a knapsack-style combinatorial optimization problem and develop novel algorithms for this setting.

The authors first partitioned the census enumeration process into five operation phases. Within each phase, one or more activities considered to be critical to census data quality were identified. Operational data from each activity were then analyzed to assess the risk of error, particularly as they related to similar activities in the 2010 census. Overall, the evaluation found that census operations relied on higher risk activities at a higher rate in 2020 than in 2010, suggesting that the risk of error may be higher in 2020 than in 2010.

Enforcing differential privacy involves adding carefully calibrated random noise to sensitive demographic information prior to its release. This change has the potential to impact policy decisions like political redistricting and other high-stakes practices, partly because tremendous federal funds and resources are allocated according to datasets (like Census data) released by the US government. One under-explored yet important application of such data is the redrawing of school attendance boundaries to foster less demographically segregated schools. In this study, we ask: how differential privacy might impact diversity-promoting boundaries in terms of resulting levels of segregation, student travel times, and school switching requirements? Simulating alternative boundaries using differentially-private student counts across 67 Georgia districts, we find that increasing data privacy requirements decreases the extent to which alternative boundaries might reduce segregation and foster more diverse and integrated schools, largely by reducing the number of students who would switch schools under boundary changes. Impacts on travel times are minimal. These findings point to a privacy-diversity tradeoff local educational policymakers may face in forthcoming years, particularly as computational methods are increasingly poised to facilitate attendance boundary redrawings in the pursuit of less segregated schools.",2023,2023-01-01,0,Keyu Zhu; Nabeel Gillani; Pascal Van Hentenryck,,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Electoral Systems and Political Participation; School Choice and Performance",arXiv (Cornell University),01,"Zhu, Keyu; Gillani, Nabeel; Hentenryck, Pascal Van. 2023.

It is now widely recognized that direct small area survey estimates are highly unreliable owing to large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area estimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of models to link these areas. Improved small area estimates are found by ""borrowing strength"" from similar neighboring areas. The key to small area estimation is shrinkage of direct estimates toward some regression estimates obtained by using in addition administrative records and other available sources of information. These shrinkage estimates can often be motivated from both a Bayesian and a frequentist point of view, and indeed in this particular context, it is possible to obtain at least an operational synthesis between the two paradigms. Thus, on one hand, while small area estimates can be developed using a hierarchical Bayesian or an empirical Bayesian approach, similar estimates are also found using the theory of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) or empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP). The present article discusses primarily normal theory-based small area estimation techniques, and attempts a synthesis between both the Bayesian and the frequentist points of view. The results are mostly discussed for random effects models and their hierarchical Bayesian counterparts. A few miscellaneous remarks are made at the end describing the current research for more complex models including some nonnormal ones.

In the absence of a population register for England, official statistics on immigration and emigration are derived from a combination of survey and census sources. The paper demonstrates how administrative data systems such as those which capture registrations of recent migrants with a local doctor, national insurance number registrations by workers from abroad and the registration of foreign students for higher education can provide data to understand patterns and trends in international migration better. The paper proposes a model for the estimation of immigration at a local level, integrating existing national estimates from the UK Office for National Statistics with data from these administrative sources. The model attempts to circumvent conceptual differences between data sets through the use of proportional distributions rather than absolute migrant counts in the estimation process. The model methodology and the results that it produces provide alternative estimates of immigration for consideration by the Office for National Statistics as it develops its own programme of improvement to subnational migration statistics.",2010,2010-03-11,41,Peter Boden; Philip Rees,University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Census and Population Estimation; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A (Statistics in Society),03,"Boden, Peter; Rees, Philip. 2010.

Our models have high goodness of fit, and each of 13 independent variables is significant at the 10% level or higher. The number of trips at Nice Ride stations is associated with neighborhood socio demographics (i.e., age and race), proximity to the central business district, proximity to water, accessibility to trails, distance to other bike share stations, and measures of economic activity.

Furthermore, recent literature suggests the phenomenon of gentrification as a cause of perpetuation or increase of racial residential segregation in some American cities. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of racial residential segregation for white, black, Asian, and Hispanic citizens in New York City in 1990, 2000, and 2010. It was possible to observe that segregation between white and Hispanic citizens and between white and Asian ones has grown, while segregation between white and black is relatively stable. Furthermore, we analyzed the per capita income and the Gini coefficient in each segregated zone, showing that the highest inequalities occur in the zones where there is an overlap of high-density zones of pair of races. Focusing on the changing of the density of population across the city during these 20 years, and by analyzing white and black people’s segregation, our analysis reveals that a positive flux of white (black) people is associated with a substantial increase (decrease) of the property values, as compared with the city mean. Furthermore, by clustering the region with the higher density of black citizens, we measured the variation of area and displacement of the four most significant clusters from 1990 to 2010.

One such innovation in e-government is the creation of 311 systems, offering a centralized platform where citizens can request services, report non-emergency concerns, and obtain information about the city via hotline, mobile, or web-based applications. The NYC 311 service request system represents one of the most significant links between citizens and city government, accounting for more than 8,000,000 requests annually. These systems are generating massive amounts of data that, when properly managed, cleaned, and mined, can yield significant insights into the real-time condition of the city. Increasingly, these data are being used to develop predictive models of citizen concerns and problem conditions within the city.

The Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and 2021, when COVID‐19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's was the seventh‐leading cause of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Members of the paid health care workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage — brought about, in part, by COVID‐19 — has occurred at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better train health care teams. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $345 billion.

We propose integer subspace differential privacy to rigorously articulate the privacy guarantee when data products maintain both the invariants and integer characteristics, and demonstrate the composition and post-processing properties of our proposal.

From 2000 to 2021 the TFR declined from 2.1 to 0.9 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world. Population projections produced by the United States Census Bureau and the United Nations Population Division show that the island population may decline from 3.8 millions in 2000 to slightly above 2 million by 2050, a dramatic 47% population decline in 50 years. As dire as this prospect may be, this may be an optimistic scenario. Both projections have the TFR increasing to 1.5 by 2050, but a fertility projection conducted by us show that fertility can remain much closer to 1.0 until 2050. Bayesian Hierarchical Probabilistic Theory has been used by the United Nations to incorporate a way to measure the uncertainty and to estimate the projection parameters. However, the assumption that the fertility level in countries with low fertility will eventually increase to 2.1 has been widely criticized as unrealistic and not supported by evidence. We modified the assumptions used by the United Nations considering countries with TFR similar to Puerto Rico and find that by 2050 Puerto Rico may have a TFR of 1.1 bounded by a 95% credibility interval (0.56,1.77).

Objective We investigated disparities in environmental justice related-variables based on home and workplace census block groups (race/ethnicity, education-levels, renter-occupied housing, median income and median home values, gentrification) based on locations of odor complaints as well as that of potentially malodorous facilities. We report key themes identified in complaints. Methods We obtained odor complaints for 2014-2023, and the locations of facilities required to submit odor management plans as of 2023 from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment. We downloaded residential census block group-level socioeconomic data from the 2016-2020 American Community Survey; and workplace-based socioeconomic data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset for 2020. We categorized neighborhoods as gentrified or not based on a typology produced by the Urban Displacement Project. We assessed exposure to potentially malodorous facilities and complaints within each census block group and investigated exposure disparities by comparing distributions of environmental justice-related variables based on if a facility or a complaint has been made, and census block group-level odor intensity categories. Results Less privileged census block groups were significantly disproportionately burdened with potentially malodorous facilities. Importantly, our study also reveals disparities in the location of facilities, not just in traditional residence/-based environmental justice-related variables, but in workplace/-based factors, as well. We did not observe similar disparities for odor complaints.

  Housing-Household Relationship Inference","Housing and household characteristics are key determinants of social and economic well-being, yet our understanding of their interrelationships remains limited. This study addresses this knowledge gap by developing a deep contrastive learning (DCL) model to infer housing-household relationships using the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS). More broadly, the proposed model is suitable for a class of problems where the goal is to learn joint relationships between two distinct entities without explicitly labeled ground truth data. Our proposed dual-encoder DCL approach leverages co-occurrence patterns in PUMS and introduces a bisect K-means clustering method to overcome the absence of ground truth labels. The dual-encoder DCL architecture is designed to handle the semantic differences between housing (building) and household (people) features while mitigating noise introduced by clustering. To validate the model, we generate a synthetic ground truth dataset and conduct comprehensive evaluations. The model further demonstrates its superior performance in capturing housing-household relationships in Delaware compared to state-of-the-art methods. A transferability test in North Carolina confirms its generalizability across diverse sociodemographic and geographic contexts. Finally, the post-hoc explainable AI analysis using SHAP values reveals that tenure status and mortgage information play a more significant role in housing-household matching than traditionally emphasized factors such as the number of persons and rooms.",2025,2025-02-16,0,Qian Xiao; Shangjia Dong; Rachel D.

We examined the geographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns, using Getis-Ord Gi* statistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDOH and adult obesity. Unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct grouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and associated SDOH indicators.Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods experiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census tract, the median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who were Black, home renters, living below the poverty level, 55 years or older, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult obesity prevalence. The grouping analysis revealed disparities in obesity prevalence among disadvantaged neighborhoods.More research is needed to examine links between geographical location, SDOH, and chronic diseases.

Measures of energy intensity based on average practice are of little use in corporate management of energy use or for public policy goal setting. In the context of companyor plant‐level indicators, it is more useful to have a measure of energy intensity that is capable of indicating where a company or plant lies within a distribution of performance. In other words, is the performance close to (or far from) the industry best practice? This article presents a parametric/statistical approach that can be used to measure best practice, thereby providing a measure of the difference, or “efficiency gap,” at a plant, company, or overall industry level. The approach requires plant‐level data and applies a stochastic frontier regression analysis used by the ENERGY STAR TM industrial energy performance indicator (EPI) to energy intensity. Stochastic frontier regression analysis separates energy intensity into three components: systematic effects, inefficiency, and statistical (random) error. The article outlines the method and gives examples of EPI analysis conducted for two industries, breweries and motor vehicle assembly. In the EPI developed with the stochastic frontier regression for the auto industry, the industry median “efficiency gap” was around 27%.",2005,2005-07-01,42,Gale Boyd,Argonne National Laboratory,Efficiency Analysis Using DEA; Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Energy Efficiency and Management,Journal of Industrial Ecology,07,"Boyd, Gale. 2005.

In this paper, I first use administrative data on SNAP receipt and amounts linked to American Community Survey data from New York State to show that survey data can misrepresent the program in important ways. For example, more than 1.4 billion dollars received are not reported in New York State alone. 46 percent of dollars received by house-holds with annual income above the poverty line are not reported in the survey data, while only 19 percent are missing below the poverty line. Standard corrections for measurement error cannot remove these biases. I then develop a method to obtain consistent estimates by combining parameter estimates from the linked data with publicly available data. This conditional density method recovers the correct estimates using public use data only, which solves the problem that access to linked administrative data is usually restricted. I examine the degree to which this approach can be used to extrapolate across time and geography, in order to solve the problem that validation data is often based on a convenience sample. I present evidence from within New York State that the extent of heterogeneity is small enough to make extrapolation work well across both time and geography.

Purpose: I assess the relationship between physical form and quality of life using neighborhood satisfaction as an empirical definition of quality of life. Methods: I examine the effects of block and neighborhood housing density, land use mix, the mix of housing structure types, and street network connectivity on residents' ratings of neighborhood satisfaction. Using a multilevel dataset that combines individual household information with neighborhood contextual variables, I compare the Charlotte, North Carolina and Portland, Oregon metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), which have very different development patterns and land use policies. Results and conclusions: At the neighborhood level, I find density and mixed land uses to be associated with higher neighborhood satisfaction in Portland, but lower neighborhood satisfaction in Charlotte. At the block level, however, I find blocks that are exclusively single family detached housing to be associated with higher neighborhood satisfaction in both MSAs. These findings suggest that the influence of compact development and mixed uses on residents' quality of life depends upon the context, and may be sensitive to the spatial scales at which urban form is examined. Takeaway for practice: Planners should understand that strategies promoting compact development and mixed uses will have different consequences in different contexts, and should pay careful attention to the appropriate spatial scale for implementing such policies. I conclude that compact growth and mixed uses improve quality of life by contributing to higher levels of neighborhood satisfaction, though they may not succeed in low density metropolitan areas. I conclude that in considering such development, planners should: rely on evidence to identify appropriate strategies; learn how to create conditions that foster urban amenities and discourage urban problems; pay attention to factors that complement the appeal of compact and mixed environments; and consider the possibility that the market will not tolerate mixing different housing types at a fine grain for the purpose of achieving higher density and diversity.

Census data show that these effects are nontrivial in relation to the magnitude of decadal changes in residential segregation. An agent-based model illustrates the potential long-run impacts of rising numbers of mixed-race households on measures of neighborhood-scale segregation. It reveals that high rates of mixed-race household formation will reduce residential segregation considerably. This occurs even when preferences for own-group neighbors are high enough to maintain racial separation in residential space in a Schelling-type model. We uncover a disturbing trend, however; levels of neighborhood-scale segregation of single-race households can remain persistently high even while a growing number of mixed-race households drives down the overall rate of residential segregation. Thus, the article's main conclusion is that parsing neighborhood segregation levels by household type-single versus mixed race-is essential to interpret correctly trends in the spatial separation of racial groups, especially when the fraction of households that are mixed race is dynamic.

We measure both markups and profitability. In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21% above marginal cost to 61% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1% to 8%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead.

We investigate four hypotheses about why one-third of multiracial American Indians and one-sixth of single-race American Indians did not write any response to the tribal affiliation question: (1) survey item non-response which undermines all fill-in-the-blank questions, (2) a non-salient tribal identity, (3) a genealogy-based affiliation, and (4) a mestizo identity which does not require a tribe.

These unit-level approaches offer many benefits over area-level modeling, such as potential for more precise estimates, construction of estimates at multiple spatial resolutions through a single model, and elimination of the need for benchmarking techniques, among others. Furthermore, many recent surveys collect interesting and complex data types at the unit level, such as text and functional data. Yet, unit-level models present two primary challenges that have limited their widespread use. First, when surveys have been sampled in an informative manner, it is critical to account for the design in some fashion when utilizing a model at the unit level. Second, unit-level datasets are inherently much larger than area-level ones, with responses that are typically non-Gaussian, leading to computational constraints. After providing a comprehensive review on the problem of informative sampling, this dissertation provides four computationally efficient methodologies for non-Gaussian survey data under informative sampling. This methodology relies on the Bayesian pseudo-likelihood to adjust for the survey design, as well as Bayesian hierarchical modeling to characterize various dependence structures. First, a count data model is developed and applied to small area estimation of housing vacancies. Second, modeling approaches for both binary and categorical data are developed, along with a variational Bayes procedure that may be used in extremely high-dimensional settings. This approach is applied to the problem of small area estimation of health insurance rates using the American Community Survey. Third, a nonlinear model is developed to allow for complex covariates, with application to text data contained within the American National Election Studies. Finally, a model is developed for functional covariates and applied to physical activity monitor data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.",2021,2021-08-01,0,Paul Arthur Parker,,Statistical Methods and Bayesian Inference; demographic modeling and climate adaptation; Spatial and Panel Data Analysis,,08,"Parker, Paul Arthur. 2021.

Under this assumption, all technical differences are Hicks neutral. I provide evidence from US manufacturing plants against Cobb-Douglas and present an alternative production function that better fits the data. A Cobb Douglas production function has two empirical implications that I show do not hold in the data: a constant cost share of capital and strong co-movement in labor productivity and capital productivity (revenue per unit of capital). Within four digit industries, differences in cost shares of capital are persistent over time. Both the capital share and labor productivity increase with revenue, but capital productivity does not. A CES production function with labor augmenting differences and an elasticity of substitution between labor and capital less than one can account for these facts. To identify the labor capital elasticity, I use variation in wages across local labor markets. Since the capital cost to labor cost ratio falls with local area wages, I strongly reject Cobb-Douglas: capital and labor are complements. Now productivity differences are no longer neutral, which has implications on how productivity affects firms' decisions to expand or contract. Non neutral technical improvements will result in higher stocks of capital but not necessarily more hiring of labor. Specifying the correct form of the production function is more generally important for empirical work, as I demonstrate by applying my methodology to address questions of mis-allocation of capital.",2011,2011-01-01,17,Devesh Raval,University of Chicago,Global trade and economics; Economic Growth and Productivity; Firm Innovation and Growth,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Raval, Devesh. 2011.

Using a confidential national survey of ethnic minority–owned businesses in the United States, this study compares the spatial distribution of Latino-owned employer firms in the Miami and Atlanta metropolitan areas. Consistent with previous research, results from this study strongly reinforce the importance of a connection between ethnic population concentration and emergence of ethnic businesses. A concentration of local businesses and co-locating with other businesses, regardless of ethnicity, are very important as well. Such agglomeration effects seem particularly important for new immigration destinations like Atlanta where a favorable entrepreneurial environment is still being developed for ethnic minority businesses. However, the positive effects from co-locating with local businesses are not linear.

We assess factors that influence the decision to become a franchisee and use various empirical approaches to correct for selection bias in our performance analyses. We find that franchised businesses on average exhibit higher survival rates than independent businesses; but importantly, the difference is small compared with claims in the trade press. The effect is also short lived: conditional on surviving a year or two, we no longer find survival (or growth) differences. We then explore two potential sources for this small survival advantage, namely franchisors’ screening process and the benefits arising from the brand and business know‐how provided by franchisors. We find evidence that both of the sources contribute to the franchising advantage.",2018,2018-10-05,15,Francine Lafontaine; Marek Zapletal; Xu Zhang,Ross School; University of Michigan; Centre for Economic Policy Research; London Business School,Franchising Strategies and Performance; Firm Innovation and Growth; Merger and Competition Analysis,Journal of Economics & Management Strategy,10,"Lafontaine, Francine; Zapletal, Marek; Zhang, Xu. 2018.

Using US census microdata, I find that multi-unit firms operate a greater number of restaurants and larger individual restaurants in larger Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). This evidence of increased profitability goes hand in hand with increases in capacity utilization through longer operating hours and more intensive production of meals and nonmeals output at individual establishments. Greater capacity exploitation is consistent with efficient firms, rather strategic behaviour, such as product proliferation or location preemption to limit rivalry. Furthermore, these results hold true for multi-unit firms but not for large national chain systems, suggesting that efficiency gains accrue from firm-specific capital, not just from marketing or distribution scale economies.",2010,2010-07-13,10,Clarissa A.

Using a uniquely comprehensive matched employer–employee dataset for the United States starting as early as 1991 and continuing to 2008, this paper shows that growing immigrant diversity in cities and workplaces is related to higher wages for workers intensively engaged in various forms of complex problem solving, including tasks involving high levels of innovation, creativity, and STEM.

We focus on the distinct influences of convergence and agglomeration on growth in the number of start-up firms as well as in employment in these new firms in a given region-industry. While reversion to the mean and diminishing returns to entrepreneurship at the region-industry level can result in a convergence effect, the presence of complementary economic activity creates externalities that enhance incentives and reduce barriers for new business creation. Clusters are a particularly important way through which location-based complementarities are realized. The empirical analysis uses a novel panel dataset from the Longitudinal Business Database of the Census Bureau and the US Cluster Mapping Project. Using this dataset, there is significant evidence of the positive impact of clusters on entrepreneurship. After controlling for convergence in start-up activity at the region-industry level, industries located in regions with strong clusters (i.e. a large presence of other related industries) experience higher growth in new business formation and start-up employment. Strong clusters are also associated with the formation of new establishments of existing firms, thus influencing the location decision of multi-establishment firms.

To identify the causal effects of common ownership on labor market outcomes, we use a firm’s addition to the S&P 500 index as a shock to the common ownership of its competitors in local labor markets. Using a matched difference-in-differences analysis, we find that, after a firm enters the S&P 500 index, the average annual earnings per employee of its local competitors decrease relative to the counterfactual. The effect of S&P 500 index additions on employee earnings is stronger in local labor markets where the employment shares of S&P 500 firms were higher or union coverage rates were lower ex ante. The effect is not driven by changes in workforce characteristics. We also find that an increase in common ownership leads to higher separation rates in treated local labor markets. Perhaps surprisingly, it increases their hiring rates even more, resulting in an overall positive effect on total employment.

A major obstacle to this work is that detailed immigration status is not widely collected in representative data sources. Some secondary data sources collect enough information to identify immigrants without a green card (non-LPRs), and researchers take different approaches to assign undocumented status to immigrants within this population. These approaches have not been compared to one another, nor do we know if they work equally well for Latino and Asian immigrants. In this research note, we test the validity of several assignment strategies using the 2001, 2004, and 2008 panels of the restricted version of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to measure differences in health-related outcomes (e.g., health insurance coverage and self-rated health) by immigration status. We compare results when immigration status is directly measured using the detailed information in the SIPP to several strategies to assign undocumented status among non-LPRs.

For over 10 years, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has supported the development of sector-specific industrial energy efficiency case studies using statistical analysis of plant level on energy use, controlling for a variety of plant production activities and characteristics. These case studies are the basis for the ENERGY STAR® Energy Performance Indicators (EPIs). These case studies fill an important gap by estimating the distribution of efficiency using detailed, sector-specific, plant-level data. These estimated distributions allow Energy Star to create ""energy-efficient plant benchmarks"" in a variety of industries using the upper quartile of the estimated efficiency distribution. Case studies have been conducted for 14 broad industries, 2 dozen sectors, and many more detailed product types. This paper is a meta-analysis of the approach that has been used in this research and the general findings regarding the estimated distribution of performance within and across industries. We find that there are few sectors that are well represented by a simple ""energy per widget"" benchmark that less energy-intensive sectors tend to exhibit a wider range of within-industry efficiency than energy-intensive sectors, but changes over time in the level and range of energy efficiency do not reveal any single pattern.",2016,2016-05-13,24,Gale Boyd,Social Science Research Council; Duke University,Energy Efficiency and Management; Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Sustainable Building Design and Assessment,Energy Efficiency,05,"Boyd, Gale. 2016.

For example, unit-level models aggregate naturally, allowing for estimates at any desired resolution, and also offer greater precision in many cases. We compare a variety of the methods available in the literature related to unit-level modeling for small area estimation. Specifically, to provide insight into the differences between methods, we conduct a simulation study that compares several of the general approaches. In addition, the methods used for simulation are further illustrated through an application to the American Community Survey.",2023,2023-06-14,4,Paul A. Parker; Ryan Janicki; Scott H.

In many cases these estimators tend to work well for quantities, such as population totals or means, but can fall short as sample sizes become small. In today's ""information age,"" there is a strong demand for more granular estimates. To meet this demand, using a Bayesian pseudolikelihood, we propose a computationally efficient unit-level modeling approach for non-Gaussian data collected under informative sampling designs. Specifically, we focus on binary and multinomial data. Our approach is both multivariate and multiscale, incorporating spatial dependence at the area level. We illustrate our approach through an empirical simulation study and through a motivating application to health insurance estimates, using the American Community Survey.",2022,2022-06-01,8,Paul A.

The Geography of Intergenerational Mobility in the United States *,"Abstract We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.",2014,2014-09-14,2386,Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren; Patrick Kline; Emmanuel Saez,"Harvard University; Harvard University; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Berkeley","Intergenerational and Educational Inequality Studies; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; School Choice and Performance",The Quarterly Journal of Economics,09,"Chetty, Raj; Hendren, Nathaniel; Kline, Patrick; Saez, Emmanuel. 2014.

We investigate the adoption, performance effects and organizational complementarities of data-driven decision making (DDD) in the U.S. Using data collected by the Census Bureau for 2005 and 2010, we observe the extent to which manufacturing firms track and use data to guide decision making, as well as their investments in information technology (IT) and the use of other structured management practices. Examining a representative sample of over 18,000 plans, we find that adoption of DDD is earlier and more prevalent among larger, older plants belonging to multi-unit firms. Smaller single-establishment firms adopt later but have a higher correlation with performance than similar non-adopters. Using a fixed-effects estimator, we find the average value-added for later DDD adopters to be 3% greater than non-adopters, controlling for other inputs to production. This effect is distinct from that associated with IT and other structured management practices and is concentrated among single-unit firms. Performance improves after plants adopt DDD, but not before – consistent with a causal relationship. However, DDD-related performance differentials decrease over time for early and late adopters, consistent with firm learning and development of organizational complementarities. Formal complementarity tests suggest that DDD and high levels of IT capital reinforce each other, as do DDD and skilled workers. For some industries, the benefits of DDD adoption appear to be greater for plants that delegate some decision making to frontline workers.",2016,2016-01-01,63,Erik Brynjolfsson; Kristina McElheran,Stanford Medicine; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Strategic Research; University of Toronto,Big Data and Business Intelligence; Data Quality and Management; Advanced Statistical Process Monitoring,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Brynjolfsson, Erik; McElheran, Kristina. 2016.

Study Design We examine time trends in employer offer, eligibility, and take‐up rates. We add a new dimension to the literature by examining dependent coverage and decomposing its trends. We investigate heterogeneity in trends by firm size. Data Collection The MEPS ‐ IC is an annual survey, sponsored by the A gency for H ealthcare R esearch and Q uality and conducted by the U.S. C ensus B ureau. The MEPS ‐ IC obtains information on establishment characteristics, whether an establishment offers health insurance, and details on up to four plans. Principal Findings We find that coverage rates for workers declined in both small and large firms. In small firms, coverage declined due to a drop in both offer and take‐up rates. In the largest firms, offer rates were stable and the decline was due to falling take‐up rates. In addition, enrollment shifted toward single coverage and away from dependent coverage in both small and large firms. For small firms, this shift was due to declining offer and take‐up rates for dependent coverage. In large firms, offers of dependent coverage were stable but take‐up rates dropped. Within the category of dependent coverage, the availability of employee‐plus‐one plans increased in all firm size categories, but take‐up rates for these plans declined in small firms.",2012,2012-01-17,25,Jessica Vistnes; Alice Zawacki; Kosali Simon; Amy K.

We empirically adjudicate between these mechanisms by merging restricted-access versions of the American Housing Survey, the Rental Housing Finance Survey, and the American Community Survey at a Census Restricted Data Center.

We compare ZIP‐Code‐level market‐based estimates of housing prices to those derived from homeowners’ self‐reported values. We show that there are systematic differences which vary with market conditions and the amount of equity owners hold in their homes. When prices have fallen, homeowners systematically state that their homes are worth more than market estimates suggest, and homeowners with little or no equity in their homes state values above the market estimates to a greater degree. Over time, homeowners appear to adjust their assessments to be more in line with past market trends, but only slowly.

The effect of tuition on enrollment is identified by the facts that tuition rates for those living within a taxing district are lower than those living outside the taxing district and in Texas not all geographic locations are in a taxing district. While the estimated effect of tuition on enrollment depends on the sample used, it is negative and mostly statistically significant in the samples of adults 18 and older and negative and sometimes statistically significant in the samples of traditional age students 18 to 24. The estimated effect of tuition on enrollment, however, is found to vary considerably by poverty level status with an increase in tuition rates having a statistically significant negative effect on college enrollment for those with household incomes that are at least 200% of the poverty level both for traditional aged students 18 to 24 years old and all adults 18 and older.",2014,2014-01-01,12,Paco Martorell; Brian P.

We hypothesize that polarization stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor.

We examine how a recent rise in firms' ability to access information technology as a service affected the survival and performance of young establishments in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Using detailed Census Bureau data, we track a large representative sample of plants from 2006 to 2014. We find that the ability to ""rent"" IT as needed – in particular, via cloud computing – was associated with significantly higher survival and growth among young plants. This contrasts with investments in traditional IT capital, which increased their likelihood of failure. Conditional on survival, young plants also exhibited much higher productivity than older plants from IT services expenditure. The effect was more important in IT-intensive and high-variance industries, consistent with a greater option value from reductions in the cost of experimenting with new IT. Also consistent with a learning-based mechanism, the effects are related more to age than to size, and apply to new establishments of existing firms.

Assimilation, on the other hand, is the major determinant of group differences between native White and Asian and Hispanic elders. While findings provide support for assimilation theory, the persistence of differentials across Asian and Hispanic groups after controlling for model covariates, and modest increases in extended living for most native-born Asian and Hispanic groups as well as native Whites in the 1990s underscores the enduring nature of ethnic diversity in living arrangements.",2010,2010-08-20,44,Douglas T.

Much of this decline in coverage is due to rising costs affecting employer's provision of health insurance benefits to their employees. One potential avenue for this is through employers changing their employment mix and decreasing the number of employees eligible for such benefits in an effort to reduce costs.

Using the 2008–10 MEPS Insurance Component augmented with information from other sources, we generate new estimates of employers’ price-sensitivity of offering insurance. Our results suggest that small and medium-size employers are sensitive to changes in the tax price of insurance, with small employers exhibiting the largest price-sensitivity. Workforce composition and local labor market conditions also influence employer offers. With these model estimates, we predict how provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—including the employer shared-responsibility requirement, premium tax credits for exchange-based coverage, and the individual mandate—affect the probability of offering ESI.

Previous studies have argued that employees willingly accept lower wages at new firms in response to offsetting benefits. A second literature argues that lower wages at new firms are driven by the selection of lower quality workers into new firms, firms which are likely to be of lower productivity or financially constrained. Using US Census employer-employee matched data, we show new evidence consistent with the selection argument. After including worker fixed effects, nearly three quarters of the new firm wage difference disappears. Moreover, once we control for firm fixed effects, absorbing time-invariant firm quality, the wage difference between new and established firms becomes economically unimportant. Overall, our findings indicate that, for a given worker who has job opportunities at similar quality new and established firms, the expected wage penalty of working at the new firm is, on average, economically insignificant. Moreover, young firms that can hire high quality workers have higher future survival rates and total employment, suggesting that human capital is an important predictor of young firm success.",2018,2018-01-01,3,Tania Babina; Wenting Ma; Paige Ouimet; Rebecca Zarutskie,Columbia University; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Federal Reserve; Federal Reserve Board of Governors,Firm Innovation and Growth; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Babina, Tania; Ma, Wenting; Ouimet, Paige; Zarutskie, Rebecca. 2018.

We argue that entrepreneurship is about experimentation; the probabilities of success are low, extremely skewed, and unknowable until an investment is made. At a macro level, experimentation by new firms underlies the Schumpeterian notion of creative destruction. However, at a micro level, investment and continuation decisions are not always made in a competitive Darwinian contest. Instead, a few investors make decisions that are impacted by incentive, agency, and coordination problems, often before a new idea even has a chance to compete in a market. We contend that costs and constraints on the ability to experiment alter the type of organizational form surrounding innovation and influence when innovation is more likely to occur. These factors not only govern how much experimentation is undertaken in the economy, but also the trajectory of experimentation, with potentially very deep economic consequences.",2014,2014-07-30,549,William R.

We use administrative data on Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation matched to American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS) household data. We show that nearly thirty-five percent of true recipient households do not report receipt in the ACS and fifty percent do not report receipt in the CPS. Misreporting, both false negatives and false positives, varies with individual characteristics, leading to complicated biases in FSP analyses. We then directly examine the determinants of program receipt using our combined administrative and survey data. The combined data allow us to examine accurate participation using individual characteristics missing in administrative data. Our results differ from conventional estimates using only survey data, as such estimates understate participation by single parents, non-whites, low income households, and other groups. To evaluate the use of Census Bureau imputed ACS and CPS data, we also examine whether our estimates using survey data alone are closer to those using the accurate combined data when imputed survey observations are excluded.

A favorable infrastructure, innovations tailored to the large Chinese market, and local firms’ rapid commercialization of products and services turned the world's largest domestic population into active online consumers, helping China overtake the US by a large margin in retail e-commerce and digital payment. While China translated digital technologies into leading business-to-customer and customer-to-customer businesses, it has not been so successful in business-to-business services. The US is still ahead in the general-purpose technologies underlying the digital economy.",2022,2022-08-01,76,Hong Jiang; Johann Peter Murmann,Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; University of St. Gallen,Blockchain Technology Applications and Security; Network Security and Intrusion Detection; China's Socioeconomic Reforms and Governance,Management and Organization Review,08,"Jiang, Hong; Murmann, Johann Peter. 2022.

The most current substate estimates of US childhood obesity use data collected in 2007. Using a spatial multilevel model and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, we estimated childhood overweight and obesity prevalence rates at the Census regional division, state, and county levels using small-area estimation with poststratification. A sample of 24,162 children aged 10-17 years was used to estimate a national overweight and obesity rate of 30.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.0%, 34.9%). There was substantial county-to-county variability (range, 7.0% to 80.9%), with 31 out of 3,143 counties having an overweight and obesity rate significantly different from the national rate. Estimates from counties located in the Pacific region had higher uncertainty than other regions, driven by a higher proportion of underrepresented sociodemographic groups. Child-level overweight and obesity was related to race/ethnicity, sex, parental highest education (P < 0.01 for all), county-level walkability (P = 0.03), and urban/rural designation (P = 0.02). Overweight and obesity remains a vital issue for US youth, with substantial area-level variability.

Initially, an RIA should start with a clear concept of what the regulatory agency is trying to estimate. Much of the popular debate is looking for a total job effect. Yet one thing we do know is that, in aggregate, there will not be a net job change unless the economy deviates from its normal rate of full employment. The gist of our literature review suggests that looking to historic data for stable statistical relationships between regulatory spending and job changes, even in a single industry, is tenuous at best. However, the intuition is relatively easy to trace out with certain assumptions: (1) added costs imply added activity that entails added jobs; (2) higher product prices or other regulatory limits imply less production that entails fewer jobs. Taking an average employment rate per dollar of relevant economic activity, coupled with an assumed demand elasticity, these effects can be multiplied out into job changes, although such simple calculations must be tested by validating key assumptions or exploring the estimates sensitivity to alternatives. New estimates by Belova, Gray, Linn and Morgenstern [(2013a). Environmental Regulation And Industry Employment: A Reassessment . Center for Economic Studies, U.S. Census Bureau Discussion Paper, CES 1336, July.] indicate that extending and expanding the widely cited approach by Morgenstern, Pizer and Shih [(2002). Jobs Versus the Environment: An Industry-Level Perspective. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 43 , 412–436] is unlikely to be successful.

These differences exist even before exporting begins and have important consequences for evaluating the gains from trade and their distribution across factors of production. The new empirical research challenges traditional models of international trade and, as a result, the focus of the international trade field has shifted from countries and industries towards firms and products.

Several measures of performance are considered: (1) change in value-added per employee (a measure of productivity); (2) change in sales per worker; (3) change in employment; and (4) establishment survival. To analyze these relationships, we merged program records from the MEP’s client and project information files with administrative records from the Census of Manufacturers and other Census databases over the periods 1997–2002 and 2002–2007 to compare the outcomes and performance of “served” and “unserved” manufacturing establishments.

Industry is an important end user of energy and relies on fossil fuels used directly for process heating and as feedstocks for a diverse range of applications. Fuel and energy use by industry is heterogeneous, meaning that even a single product group can vary broadly in its production routes and associated energy usage. In the US, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) serves as the basis for data collection and reporting. In turn, data based on NAICS is the foundation of most US energy modeling. Thus, the effectiveness of NAICS at representing energy use is a limiting condition for plans to improve energy efficiency and alternatives to fossil fuels in industry. Facility-level data to build more detail into heterogeneous sectors is scarce. This work explores alternative classification schemes for industry based on energy use characteristics, and provides a validation of an approach to make facility-level energy use estimates based on publicly available data from the greenhouse gas reporting program. First, several approaches to industrial taxonomies and their usefulness for industrial energy modeling are summarized. Data from Industrial Assessment Centers is analyzed using unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect clusters. Cladistics, an approach from biology, is adapted to energy and process characteristics of industries. A cladogram is presented for evolutionary directions in the iron and steel sector. Cladograms are a promising tool for constructing scenarios and summarizing directions of sectoral innovation. Finally, validation is performed for facility-level energy estimates from the US EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This validation assists in making this data source available for use in energy modeling. Together, this work explores alternative approaches for categorizing industries in a way that aids understanding energy use, and presenting pathways for the future.",2022,2022-10-10,1,Liz Wachs; Colin McMillan; Gale Boyd; Matt Doolin,National Renewable Energy Laboratory; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Duke University; Duke University,Environmental Impact and Sustainability; Iron and Steelmaking Processes; Global Energy and Sustainability Research,,10,"Wachs, Liz; McMillan, Colin; Boyd, Gale; Doolin, Matt. 2022.

The analysis reveals significant variation in the intrametropolitan distribution of export-related activities, with Long Beach, El Segundo, Hawthorne, and Irvine recording the highest export intensities in the region. The results also show that, on average: Asian and Hispanic workers are more dependent on exportrelated activity; female workers with low levels of education have higher export-dependency ratios; and, for male workers, export-dependency ratios are highest for those with higher levels of education. Concerning the impact of exports on wages, the evidence suggests that there is a positive relationship between both and that it is highest for White and Black workers.

Using disaggregated U.S. import data, we create a new measure of trade costs over time and industries. As the models predict, productivity growth is faster in industries with falling trade costs. We also find evidence supporting the major hypotheses of the heterogeneous-firm models. Plants in industries with falling trade costs are more likely to die or become exporters.

These results are not driven by firms being less productive, having expanded too much prior to the Great Recession, or being generally more sensitive to fluctuations in either aggregate employment or house prices. Likewise, at the county level, we find that counties with more highly levered firms experienced significantly larger declines in employment in response to local consumer demand shocks.

To provide a context for the analyses, the authors selected two small commercial areas of about the same number of commercial establishments—one in Troy, NY, and the other in New York City—and applied freight and service trip generation models to estimate the total freight and service traffic generated at these sites. Then, using different assumptions of the amount of time these vehicles spend at a parking location, the authors estimated the number of parking spaces required by time of day under different assumptions of demand management. The results show that parking needs are proportional to the average parking durations. Essentially, the longer the duration the higher the parking needs. In terms of impacts on demand management, the results show that the 100% Off-Hour Deliveries (OHD) program is expected to be the most impactful as it reduces the parking needs by 70–80% during peak hours. In second place, Staggered Deliveries reduces parking needs by about 60% during the peak hours. The third place is occupied by the 30% OHD Scenario and the Receiver-Led Consolidation programs, which are virtually tied, offering about 10–25% reduction. The initial analysis revealed the importance of parking duration as it was shown to be proportional to parking needs; the longer the duration the higher the need for parking. The delivery simulation further bolstered this finding by showing that the optimal case occurs (i.e. minimizing parking duration) the closer the parking location is to the establishment. The further away the vehicle is parked the longer the walking time to the establishment, hence increasing the time the vehicle occupies the parking spot. The strategies applied to the case studies showed that Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies are effective in decreasing the number of parking spots needed during peak periods.",2018,2018-06-01,35,Shama Campbell; José Holguín‐Veras; Diana G.

The chief conclusion is that the accuracy of freight generation (FG) and freight trip generation (FTG) models depends on the consistency between the model's structure and actual FG-FTG patterns, the degree of internal heterogeneity of the economic and land use aggregation used to estimate the model, and the appropriateness of the spatial aggregation procedure used to obtain the desired FG-FTG estimates. Relative to model structure, the paper establishes strong reasons to treat FG and FTG as separate concepts, because the latter is the output of logistic decisions, whereas the former is determined by the economics of production and consumption. The connection between business size variables–for example, employment–and FG is relatively strong because they are economic input factors, whereas the one with FTG is weaker because inventory and transportation costs come into play. Thus it is generally not correct to assume proportionality between FTG and business size or to assume that using constant FTG rates could be problematic. For instance, only 18% of the industry sectors in New York City exhibit constant FTG rates per employee. For economic and land use aggregation, the finer the level of detail the better, as independent variables have a better chance to explain FG-FTG. In the case of spatial aggregation, the correct aggregation procedure depends on the underlying disaggregate model. For a FG-FTG model to work well, both economic and land use and spatial aggregations must be appropriate.",2011,2011-01-01,152,José Holguín‐Veras; Miguel Jaller; Lisa Destro; Xuegang Ban; Catherine T.

Alternative data dissemination methods used in practice include releasing summary/aggregate tables, suppressing detailed geographic information in public-use data sets, and accessing restricted data via Research Data Centers. This research examines an alternative method for disseminating microdata that contains more geographical details than are currently being released in public-use data files. Specifically, the method replaces the observed survey values with imputed, or synthetic, values simulated from a hierarchical Bayesian model. Confidentiality protection is enhanced because no actual values are released. The method is demonstrated using restricted data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. The analytic validity of the synthetic data is assessed by comparing small area estimates obtained from the synthetic data with those obtained from the observed data.",2014,2014-09-01,4,Joseph W.

We theorize that individuals' turnover decisions are affected by the interaction of individual performance with the firm's compensation dispersion relative to its competitors. We test our theory using linked employer‐employee data from the legal services industry. We find that individuals with extreme high performance are less likely to leave firms that offer higher compensation dispersion than competitors, however, if they do leave these employers, they are more likely to create new ventures. In contrast, employees with extreme low performance are more likely to leave firms with more compensation dispersion than competitors, and these individuals are less likely to engage in new venture creation.

Using a confidential data set extracted from the United States Decennial Long Form Data 2000 and a multilevel regression modeling strategy, this article presents a case study of Chinese immigrants in the San Francisco metropolitan area. Correspondent with the highly segregated nature of the labor market between Chinese immigrant men and women, different socioeconomic characteristics at the census tract level are significantly related to their occupational segregation. The results of this study suggest that the social process of labor market segmentation is contingent on the immigrant geography of residence and workplace. Whereas the direction and magnitude of the spatial contingency are different between men and women, residency in Chinese immigrant-concentrated areas is perpetuating gender occupational segregation by skill level. Abundant ethnic resources might exist in ethnic neighborhoods and enclaves for certain types of employment opportunities; however, these resources do not necessarily help Chinese immigrant workers, especially women, to move upward in the labor market hierarchy.",2009,2009-12-16,41,Qingfang Wang,University of North Carolina at Charlotte,"Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy; Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",Annals of the Association of American Geographers,12,"Wang, Qingfang. 2009.

The growth in inequality parallels the rapid rise in U.S. imports, particularly from developing economies. Standard trade theory suggests that the wages of unskilled workers relative to skilled workers will decline in developed economies as a result of greater competition from developing economies that have abundant reserves of unskilled labor; however, repeated empirical studies have not found a strong link between trade and inequality. We argue that this failure results from the use of aggregate data and poor proxies for the skill level of workers. A matched employer–employee database for the Los Angeles consolidated metropolitan statistical area in 1990 and 2000, combining individual returns from the Decennial Household Census and manufacturing plant-level data, shows the relationship between the growth of trade and the relative wages of workers with different levels of education. Wage inequality resulted from trade as well as skill-biased technological change in 1990. In 2000, skill-biased technological change has no significant impact on inequality, and the influence of trade has become much stronger. Over the ten years studied, the impact of trade climbs the education and skill ladder. Trade depressed the relative wages of workers with less than a high school diploma in 1990, but by 2000 trade also significantly reduced the relative wages of high school graduates.",2008,2008-09-05,17,David L.

These extents are represented by updates to the 100-year floodplain by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and urban changes in land use, land value, and socio-economic characteristics of flood exposed populations. We focus on six local community districts containing disproportionately vulnerable communities. Across our study areas, we observed increases in the floodplain’s extent by 45.7%, total exposed population by 10.5%, and population living in vulnerable communities by 7.5%. Overall flood risk increases regardless of increases in the updated floodplain extent, as do floodplain property values. However, variability is high between community districts; in some cases, increases in exposure coincide with decreases in vulnerability due to shifts in racial demographics and increases in income (i.e. potential floodplain gentrification), while others experienced increases in exposure and vulnerability (i.e. double jeopardy). These findings highlight that the dominant drivers of coastal flood risk in NYC are ongoing real estate development and continued increases in sea level rise and storm severity, both of which have explicit implications for flood vulnerability. We describe the social processes governing development in the flood zone, namely zoning, resilience planning, and the determination of potential flooding severity and related insurance rates. We also discuss how these social drivers of risk intersect with social dimensions of vulnerability due to racist housing markets, and the distributions of public housing and toxic chemical hazards. We conclude with a framework for the analysis of contextual and outcome-based vulnerability to coastal flood hazards, and provide policy recommendations to reduce risks over the medium to long term.",2020,2020-07-29,48,Pablo Herreros‐Cantis; Veronica Olivotto; Zbigniew R.

In Search of Spillovers through Backward LinkagesAuthors/Editors: Beata SmarzynskaBeata Smarzynskahttps://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-2923SectionsAboutPDF (0.1 MB) ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack Citations ShareFacebookTwitterLinked In Abstract:Many countries compete against one another in attracting foreign investors by offering ever more generous incentive packages and justifying their actions with the productivity gains that are expected to accrue to domestic producers from knowledge externalities generated by foreign affiliates. Despite this being hugely important to public policy choices, there is little conclusive evidence indicating that domestic firms benefit from foreign presence in their sector. It is possible, though, that researchers have been looking for foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers in the wrong place. Multinationals have an incentive to prevent information leakage that would enhance the performance of their local competitors in the same industry but at the same time may want to transfer knowledge to their local suppliers in other sectors. Spillovers from FDI may be, therefore, more likely to take place through backward linkages—that is, contacts between domestic suppliers of intermediate inputs and their multinational clients—and thus would not have been captured by the earlier literature. This paper focuses on the understudied issue of FDI spillovers through backward linkages and goes beyond existing studies by shedding some light on factors driving this phenomenon. It also improves over existing literature by addressing several econometric problems that may have biased the results of earlier research. Based on a firm-level panel data set from Lithuania, the estimation results are consistent with the existence of productivity spillovers. They suggest that a 10 percent increase in the foreign presence in downstream sectors is associated with 0.38 percent rise in output of each domestic firm in the supplying industry. The data indicate that these spillovers are not restricted geographically, since local firms seem to benefit from the operation of downstream foreign affiliates on their own, as well as in other regions. The results further show that greater productivity benefits are associated with domestic-market, rather than export-oriented, foreign affiliates. But no difference is detected between the effects of fully-owned foreign firms and those with joint domestic and foreign ownership. The findings of a positive correlation between productivity growth of domestic firms and the increase in multinational presence in downstream sectors should not, however, be interpreted as a call for subsidizing FDI. These results are consistent with the existence of knowledge spillovers from foreign affiliates to their local suppliers, but they may also be a result of increased competition in upstream sectors. While the former case would call for offering FDI incentive packages, it would not be the optimal policy in the latter. Certainly more research is needed to disentangle these two effects. This paper—a product of Trade, Development Research Group—is part of a larger effort in the group to study the contribution of trade and foreign direct investment to technology transfer.

Firms that trade goods play an important role in the U.S., employing more than a third of the U.S. workforce. We find that the most globally engaged U.S. firms, i.e. those that both export to and import from related parties, dominate U.S. trade flows and employment at trading firms.

The objective of this study is to examine the extent to which value generated by information systems for collaborating versus transacting is contingent upon demand volatility. We analyze a unique dataset assembled from non‐public U.S. Census Bureau data of manufacturing plants. Our findings suggest that when faced with volatile demand, plants employing information systems for collaborating with suppliers and customers experience positive and significant benefits to performance, in terms of both labor productivity and inventory turnover. In contrast, results suggest that plants employing information systems for transacting in volatile environments do not experience such benefits. Further exploratory analysis suggests that in the context of demand volatility, these two distinct dimensions of IT‐based integration have differing performance implications at different stages of the production process in terms of raw‐materials inventory and finished‐goods inventory, but not in terms of work‐in‐process inventory. Taken together, our study contributes to theoretical and managerial understanding of the contingent value of information systems in volatile demand conditions in the supply chain context.",2013,2013-07-27,71,Terence Saldanha; Nigel P.

The model provides a good fit to the dynamics of firm entry and exit, output, and R&amp;D.

However, little work has examined whether high‐tech industries respond differently than traditional manufacturing to changing trade pressures. This study investigates the impact of international trade on skilled and unskilled labor demand across manufacturing sectors. Results of this study indicate that changes in exchange rates and trade orientation have similar effects across high‐tech and traditional manufacturing sectors. In addition, findings suggest that there is a high degree of variation in the trade‐related effects on labor demand across individual high‐tech sectors, and that the direction of these effects often runs counter to the predictions of traditional trade theory.",2008,2008-05-06,18,Julie A.

Past research on U.S. plants has supported the existence of an export wage premium, though European studies dispute those results, calling for more care in econometric investigation to control for worker characteristics. The authors answer this call by developing a matched employee-employer data set linking worker characteristics from the one-in-six long form of the Decennial Household Census to manufacturing establishment data from the Longitudinal Research Database. Analysis focuses on 1990 and 2000 data for the Los Angeles Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. Results confirm that the average wage in manufacturing plants that export is larger. However, after controlling for worker characteristics such as age, gender, education, race, and nationality, the export wage premium vanishes. That is, when comparing workers with similar characteristics, there is no wage difference between exporting and nonexporting plants.

Organizations' Employment of Male and Female Managers,"We examine the effects of organizations' employment practices on sex-based ascription managerial jobs. Given men's initial preponderance management, we argue that inertia, sex labels, and power dynamics predispose organizations to use sex-based ascription when staffing managerial jobs, but that personnel practices can invite or curtail ascription. Our results-based on data from a national probability sample of 516 work organizations-show that specific personnel practices affect the sexual division of managerial labor. Net of controls for the composition of the labor supply, open recruitment methods are associated with women holding a greater share of management jobs, while recruitment through informal networks increases men's share. Formalizing personnel practices reduces men's share of management jobs, especially large establishments, presumably because formalization checks ascription job assignments, evaluation, and factors that affect attrition. Thus, through their personnel practices, establishments license or limit ascription. B ARON and Bielby (1980) encouraged researchers interested labor market to bring the firm back in because firms link the 'macro' and 'micro' dimensions of work organization and inequality (p. 738). Researchers who have taken up the call have demonstrated the importance of organizational structures, such as their nonprofit or government status or their size, for sustaining or eroding sex-based ascription (Baron 1991; Baron and Newman 1990; Nelson and Bridges 1999; TomaskovicDevey 1993).

The Red Dog Mine -- a joint venture between Teck Resources, Inc. and the NANA Regional Corporation -- has often been cited as an example for developing extractive industries in a way that does benefit Indigenous communities. The mine is located in an economically impoverished region in Northwest Alaska that has few other wage-earning opportunities for the largely Iñupiat population. Although the mine has brought demonstrable financial benefits to the region, questions persist about its long-term benefits to local communities. This paper assesses a suite of long-term benefits of the Red Dog mine, based on findings from unique 14-year panel dataset. The paper focuses on the direct effects of the mine on the individual Indigenous workers of the region. Specifically, the analysis addressed the following set of questions: How does employment at Red Dog affect workers' mobility and long-run earnings? How long do most local residents hired to work at the mine keep these jobs? What percentage of the mine workers live in the communities in the region, and what percentage of the total payroll do local workers receive? The findings illustrate the strengths and limitations of partnerships between Indigenous organizations and extractive industries, and offer insights relevant to Indigenous communities across the arctic and around the world as they plan development of local resources.",2020,2020-02-21,21,Matthew Berman; Robert Loeffler; Jennifer I.

Studies of income inequality, however, are constrained by the tabular format in which censuses publish income data. In this article, the author proposes a new method, Lorenz interpolation, for estimating income inequality from binned income data. Using public microsample data from the American Community Survey (ACS), the author shows that Lorenz interpolation produces more accurate and reliable income inequality estimates than do alternative estimation methods. Then, using restricted ACS income data obtained through a Federal Statistical Research Data Center, the author evaluates the accuracy of Lorenz interpolation at the census tract and school district levels. Lorenz interpolation produces reliable school district–level estimates, but the method produces less reliable estimates for some income inequality measures at the tract level. These findings indicate that researchers should refrain from estimating tract-level income inequality measures from tabular data. They also show that aggregating tract income distributions to higher geographic levels can produce valid estimates of income inequality.",2022,2022-04-07,0,Andrew Carr,Duke University,"Income, Poverty, and Inequality; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Psychological Well-being and Life Satisfaction",Sociological Methodology,04,"Carr, Andrew. 2022.

In addition, we find that plants whose future output levels are subject to greater uncertainty tend to use more temporary workers.

Using plant-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau, I explore the consequences and sources of this variation in materials prices. For a sample of industries with relatively homogeneous products, the standard deviation of plant-level productivity would be 7% smaller if all plants faced the same materials prices. Moreover, plant-level materials prices are persistent, spatially correlated, and positively associated with the probability of exit. The contribution of entry and exit to aggregate productivity growth is smaller for productivity measures that are purged of materials price variation. After documenting these patterns, I discuss three potential sources of materials price variation: geography, differences in suppliers’ marginal costs, and within-supplier markup differences. Together, these variables explain 15% of the variation of materials prices.

In the past, political parties, unions, and fraternal and mutual-aid societies served as important vehicles for workers who hoped to achieve political and economic integration. As these traditional civic institutions have weakened, low-wage workers must seek new structures for mutual support. Worker centers are among the institutions to which workers turn as they strive to build vibrant communities and attain economic and political visibility. Community-based worker centers help low-wage workers gain access to social services; advocate for their own civil and human rights; and organize to improve wages, working conditions, neighborhoods, and public schools.In this pathbreaking book, Janice Fine identifies 137 worker centers in more than eighty cities, suburbs, and rural areas in thirty-one states. These centers, which attract workers in industries that are difficult to organize, have emerged as especially useful components of any program intended to assist immigrants and low-wage workers of color. Worker centers serve not only as organizing laboratories but also as places where immigrants and other low-wage workers can participate in civil society, tell their stories to the larger community, resist racism and anti-immigrant sentiment, and work to improve their political and economic standing.",2006,2006-10-01,411,Janice Fine,,"Labor Movements and Unions; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",Choice Reviews Online,10,"Fine, Janice. 2006.

They rely on a newly assembled dataset that draws from different micro data sources (business registers, census, or representative enterprise surveys). The novelty of their approach is in the harmonization of firm-level data across countries, which enables international comparisons and the identification of country-specific factors as opposed to sector and time effects. All countries display a massive reallocation of resources, with the entry and exit of many firms in all markets, the failure of many newcomers, and the expansion of successful ones. This process of creative destruction affects productivity directly by reallocating resources toward more productive uses, but also indirectly through the effects of increased market contestability. There are also large differences across groups of countries. While entry and exit rates are fairly similar across industrial countries, post-entry performance differs markedly between Europe and the United States, a potential indication of the importance of barriers to firm growth as opposed to barriers to entry. Transition economies show an even more impressive process of creative destruction and those that have progressed the most toward a market economy show better outcomes from this process. Finally, Mexico shows large firm dynamics with many new firms entering the battle but also many failing rapidly, while Argentina resembles Continental Europe with smaller flows and less impressive post-entry growth of successful firms. This paper—a product of the Social Protection Team, Human Development Network—is part of a larger effort in the network to understand the process of creative destruction.

We find that the vast majority of U.S. manufacturing plants operate in a monopsonistic environment and, at least since the early 2000s, the labor market in U.S. manufacturing has become more monopsonistic. To reach this conclusion, we exploit rich administrative data for U.S. manufacturers and estimate plant-level markdowns—the ratio between a plant's marginal revenue product of labor and its wage. In a competitive labor market, markdowns would be equal to unity. Instead, we find substantial deviations from perfect competition, as markdowns average 1.53. This result implies that a worker employed at the average manufacturing plant earns 65 cents on each dollar generated on the margin. To investigate long-term trends in employer market power, we propose a novel measure for the aggregate markdown that is consistent with aggregate wedges and also incorporates the local nature of labor markets. We find that the aggregate markdown decreased between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, but has been sharply increasing since.",2022,2022-03-04,31,Chen Yeh; Claudia Macaluso; Brad J. Hershbein,W.E.

Most research on disconnection has focused on personal attributes as risk factors for experiencing disconnection at a static point in time. This study adopts a dynamic perspective and broadens the existing set of determinants by adding regional socioeconomic characteristics to explain changes in status. Results from multivariate survival analyses demonstrate that residence in a disadvantaged county is associated with an increased risk of becoming disconnected. State-level policies, as opposed to county socioeconomic characteristics, have stronger influences on movements out of disconnection.

We hypothesize that firm experience prior to setting up a new venture influences the ability to learn from experience after start-up (which is a key capability), and that this relationship is moderated by the importance of learning by doing within the new venture's industry (which is a critical aspect of the industry environment). We argue that together, these relationships influence performance differences among new plant ventures of incumbents, diversifying entrants, and entrepreneurial (de novo) entrants. Using data on 47,915 new plant ventures in U.S. manufacturing, we find that incumbents and diversifying entrants establish significantly more productive new plants than de novo entrants, and that this advantage significantly increases with the importance of learning by doing in an industry (industry learning intensity). These productivity differences appear to be driven more by learning subsequent to plant start-up than by initial disparities in productivity. Together, these findings strongly suggest that pre-start-up experience adds to the process of post-start-up learning, and that the industry learning environment plays an important role in whether entrepreneurial firms can achieve a competitive advantage over existing firms.

We find that U.S. plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). Consistent with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, goods imported by U.S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries. U.S. plants shift production to less pollution-intensive industries, produce less waste, and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from LWCs. The negative impact of LWC imports on emissions is stronger for U.S. plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance, but weaker for more-capable U.S. plants and firms. These results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capability in explaining firms' offshoring and environmental strategies. Managerial summary: Using confidential trade, production, and pollution data of more than 8,000 firms and 18,000 plants from the U.S. Census Bureau for years 1992–2009, we find that U.S. plants release less toxic emissions when their parent firm imports more from low-wage countries (LWCs). In addition, goods imported by U.S. firms from LWCs are in more pollution-intensive industries. U.S. plants shift production to less pollution-intensive industries, produce less waste, and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent imports more from LWCs. However, not all U.S. firms choose to ""offshore pollution."" U.S. plants located in counties with greater institutional pressure for environmental performance offshore more, but more-capable U.S. plants and firms offshore less.

We establish five stylized facts that are relevant for the extent of granularity and the nature of growth in the U.S. economy: (1) with an estimated shape parameter significantly below 1, the best-fitting Pareto distribution substantially differs from Zipf's law for both firms and establishments; (2) a lognormal distribution fits both establishment and firm size distributions better than the commonly-used Pareto distribution, even far in the upper tail; (3) a convolution of lognormal and Pareto distributions fits both size distributions better than lognormal alone while also providing a better fit for the employment share distribution; (4) the estimated parameters are different across manufa cturing and services sectors, but the distribution fit ranking remains unchanged in the sectoral subsamples.

We study the impact of import competition on U.S. corporate innovation and present some new perspectives. We conjecture that U.S. firms view import competition from high-wage countries (HWCs) as “neck-and-neck” competition and will respond by intensifying innovation. In contrast, U.S. firms will reduce innovation in response to import competition from low-wage countries (LWCs), because such competition does not always increase the potential benefits from innovation. Our empirical results are supportive. We find that, when confronting HWC import competition, U.S. firms increase R&D spending while intensifying and improving innovation output (file more patents, receive more citations to their patents, and produce more breakthrough patents). Moreover, U.S. firms closest to the technological frontier – largest firms, firms with the largest stocks of knowledge, and most profitable firms – increase and improve their innovation the most in response to HWC competition. These results shed light on the relationship between product market competition and innovation, and point to the origin of import competition as a determinant of innovation decisions made by different U.S. companies.",2017,2017-04-19,5,Xiaoyang Li; Yue Maggie Zhou,Shanghai Jiao Tong University,Firm Innovation and Growth; Economic Growth and Productivity; Global trade and economics,Advances in strategic management,04,"Li, Xiaoyang; Zhou, Yue Maggie. 2017.

We use very large samples on a wide variety of measures of child well‐being that are also linked to long histories of parent earnings from administrative records. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the use of longer time averages of parent earnings leads to substantially higher estimated associations compared to using only a single year of parent earnings. Using 7‐year time averages of parent earnings, we show, for example, that a doubling of parent earnings is associated with a reduced probability of a teenager reporting being in poor health by close to 50% and a decrease in the likelihood of a child repeating a grade by 39%. We also examine how the associations vary by the timing of when parental earnings are received during childhood. We find suggestive evidence that parental earnings received during the child's school‐going years (ages 6 to 17) are more strongly associated with college enrollment and children's future earnings as adults than parent earnings received earlier or later in the child's life .

Primary materials conversion, e.g., iron ore and scrap into steel, limestone and sand into cement and glass, or wood and other fibers into paper, tend to be the most energy-intensive in the production process, while final consumer products like electronics and clothing require the least energy. This leads to something like the 80-20 rule, where a large portion of energy use is in a small number of industries. For example, the 2006 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS) reported that 75 percent of fuel use arises from only five of the 21 three-digit industries, using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). These five sectors are a small share of the total U.S. economy. The energy intensity for different industrial sectors is easily measured using published government statistics, but the plants within these industries are not homogeneous entities.

Also, firms with higher demand‐specific factors have higher probability to expand, whereas average firm‐level physical productivity turns out to be an insignificant determinant of firm expansion.

In this article, I estimate the effects of headquarters’ proximity to plants on plant-level investment and productivity. Using the introduction of new airline routes as a source of exogenous variation in proximity, I find that new airline routes that reduce the travel time between headquarters and plants lead to an increase in plant-level investment of 8% to 9% and an increase in plants’ total factor productivity of 1.3% to 1.4%. The results are robust when I control for local and firm-level shocks that could potentially drive the introduction of new airline routes, when I consider only new airline routes that are the outcome of a merger between two airlines or the opening of a new hub, and when I consider only indirect flights where either the last leg of the flight (involving the plant’s home airport) or the first leg of the flight (involving headquarters’ home airport) remains unchanged. Moreover, the results are stronger in the earlier years of the sample period and for firms whose headquarters is more time-constrained. In addition, they also hold at the extensive margin, that is, when I consider plant openings and closures.",2012,2012-12-20,523,Xavier Giroud,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Aviation Industry Analysis and Trends; Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Corporate Finance and Governance,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,12,"Giroud, Xavier. 2012.

Unaffordable and inadequate household energy presents adverse consequences that are amplified by poverty and a changing climate. To date, the connections between energy, socioeconomic disadvantage, and wellbeing are generally underappreciated, and its connection to climate change is under researched.Building on the energy insecurity framework, this review explores literature related to household energy, poverty and health in order to highlight the disproportionate burdens borne by vulnerable populations in adequately meeting household energy needs. This paper is based on a comprehensive review of books, peer-reviewed articles, and reports published between 1990 to 2019 identified via databases including JSTOR, and PubMed. A total of 406 publications were selected as potential for a full review, 203 received full review, and 159 were included in this paper on the basis of set inclusion criteria.From the literature review, we created an original heuristic model that describes energy insecurity as either acute or chronic and further explore the mediators and pathways that link energy insecurity to health. In the discussion, we posit that extant literature does not sufficiently consider that vulnerable communities often experience energy insecurity bundled with other hardships. We also discuss energy, poverty, and health through the lens of climate change, critiquing that most research on household energy does not consider climate change. This evidence is important for enhancing research in this field, and developing programmatic and policy interventions as they pertain to energy access, affordability and health with special emphasis on vulnerable populations, climate change and social inequality.",2019,2019-12-12,273,Sonal Jessel; Samantha Sawyer; Diana Hernández,Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,Energy and Environment Impacts; Climate Change and Health Impacts; Child Nutrition and Water Access,Frontiers in Public Health,12,"Jessel, Sonal; Sawyer, Samantha; Hernández, Diana. 2019.

By using the 2008–2012 area‐identified National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), we evaluate the effect of neighborhood immigrant concentration on individual violence risk across race/ethnicity and labor market stratification factors in areas with different histories of immigration. The results of our analysis reveal three key patterns. First, we find a consistent protective role of immigrant concentration that is not weakened by low education, low income, unemployment, or labor market competition. Therefore, even economically disadvantaged people enjoy the crime‐reduction benefit of immigration. Second, we find support for threshold models that predict a nonlinear, stronger protective role of immigrant concentration on violence at higher levels of immigrant concentration. The protective function of immigration also is higher in areas of longer histories of immigration. Third, compared with Blacks and Whites, Latinos receive a greater violence‐reduction benefit of immigrant concentration possibly because they live in closer proximity with immigrants and share common sociocultural features. Nevertheless, immigrant concentration yields a diminishing return in reducing Latino victimization as immigrants approach a near‐majority of neighborhood residents. The implications of these results are discussed.",2018,2018-02-02,20,Min Xie; Eric P.

Social Security increases tax revenue from workers each year and pays out benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries. The results on annual redistribution describe large annual transfers of resources among different demographic groups—transfers that depend mostly on the ratio of beneficiaries to earners within each group. Its progressive benefit formula is the fundamental source of intracohort redistribution from Social Security. Different definitions of income can lead to different interpretations of the strength of the relationship between income and the transfers from Social Security. Low-income individuals clearly receive a higher rate of return from Social Security than higher-income individuals. The income-based redistribution in the current Social Security system is fairly modest compared to the total benefits paid.,2002,2002-01-01,142,Jeffrey B.

Using both structural and price‐based measures of regional trade involvement, we evaluate the effects of trade on inequality within and across states, the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan portions of the states, and the major census regions. Across all states and metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, we found that trade affects inequality primarily via import and export prices. In contrast to our expectations, however, a weaker dollar—more expensive imports and cheaper exports—is associated with the worsening of a state's position relative to other states and greater inequality within the state. Across the census regions, both our price and orientation measures had significant effects, but the direction of these effects varied by region. Whereas many regions benefited from cheaper imports, states in regions that are traditionally home to low‐wage sectors, including the Southeast and South Central regions, were made relatively worse off by lower import prices and by greater orientation toward import‐competing goods. Our findings reinforce notions about the uneven impacts of globalization and suggest that policy measures are needed to ensure that both the benefits and costs of involvement in international trade are shared across regions.",2004,2004-07-01,80,Julie A.

Models simultaneously taking into account both violent and property crime consistently found that property crime actually has a negative effect on perceived crime.

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.",2002,2002-07-28,3842,Robert J.

In addition to providing accurate and precise demand threshold estimates at a highly disaggregated industry level, we also explore how location outcomes differ across employers and non-employers using Poisson and negative binomial estimations as well as their zero inflated counterparts. Findings provide insight into the industrial organization of retail industries and suggest that important retail location determinants include retail leakages, sector interdependencies, social capital, natural assets, and other place-based factors.

There is growing evidence that holding schools accountable is leading to some improved educational outcomes for students. There is in contrast very little work examining whether these sweeping reforms have unintended consequences for the communities which these schools are serving. As school attendance, particularly at the elementary school level, is closely tied to oneâ€™s residence, placing sanctions on a school could have negative repercussions for neighborhoods if it provides new information on school failure. In contrast, if these sanctions also bring new resources, including financial resources or school choice, they could spark additional demand within a neighborhood. Through the use of restricted access census data, which includes local housing values, rents and individual residential choices in combination with the use of a boundary discontinuity identification strategy, this paper seeks to examine how failure to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), the key enforcement mechanism of NCLB, is shaping local housing markets and residential choices in five diverse urban school districts: New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit and Tucson.",2017,2017-01-01,0,Keren Mertens Horn,University of Massachusetts Boston,"Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Horn, Keren Mertens. 2017.

We find similar results at the industry level: industries with falling growth rates see more left-skewed growth rates of firm sales, employment, and productivity. We then build a heterogeneous-agent model in which entrepreneurs face shocks with time-varying skewness that matches the firm-level distributions we document for the United States. Our quantitative results show that a negative shock to the skewness of firms’ productivity growth (keeping the mean and variance constant) generates a persistent drop in output, investment, hiring, and consumption.

We then examine the impact of industry opportunities and constraints on the propensity of high human capital individuals to form spinouts. Counter intuitively, we find that both industry constraints measured as industry capital intensity) and opportunities (industry R&D intensity) reduce the propensity of higher human capital individuals to form spinouts. We interpret these results as being consistent with the argument that high human capital founders are more likely to choose larger, more capital-intensive projects than low human capital individuals, and thus face greater constraints. On the other side, R&D intensive industries appear to present abundant entrepreneurial opportunities, allowing low human capital individuals to identify their own opportunities thus decreasing the relative advantage of high human capital individuals.",2015,2015-01-01,0,Natarajan Balasubramanian; Mariko Sakakibara,"Syracuse University; University of California, Los Angeles",Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences; Corporate Finance and Governance; Family Business Performance and Succession,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Balasubramanian, Natarajan; Sakakibara, Mariko. 2015.

This article shows that changes in credit supply conditions have much deeper effects on firms' population dynamics, well above and beyond the experience of entry. I explore the hypothesis that changes in credit supply have important effects on the demand side as well. I conjecture that when financial capital is difficult to obtain, while fewer firms may enter, those entering are drawn from a population with a better distribution of entrepreneurial quality. In an environment where financial capital is easily obtainable instead, the population of loan applicants changes as well, including those in a tougher environment who would not have tried entrepreneurship in the first place. These changes in the population of applicants imply significant effects on firms' life expectancy profile, and these effects are heterogeneous across firms of different vintage. Modifications in life expectancy are likely to affect firms' incentives in undertaking future capital investment and likewise investments in technological innovation. Hence, these changes in overall firms' population dynamics characterize an explicit mechanism through which finance can affect real economic activity.

Statistical agencies regularly collect data from small areas but are prevented from releasing detailed geographical identifiers in public-use data sets due to disclosure concerns. Alternative data dissemination methods used in practice include releasing summary/aggregate tables, suppressing detailed geographic information in public-use data sets, and accessing restricted data via Research Data Centers. This research examines an alternative method for disseminating microdata that contains more geographical details than are currently being released in public-use data files.

This is because evidence of discrimination is difficult to obtain. Two individuals may be treated equally, but this does not prove discrimination unless we can show that the differences in treatment were not justified by differences in productivity. The method most commonly used to identify wage discrimination, the Oaxaca decomposition, is flawed because any omitted variables that are correlated with gender will contribute to the unexplained portion of the wage gap, leading to an over- or under-estimation of wage discrimination. Audit studies provide more direct evidence of differential treatment, but are costly to carry out. Only a small number of studies attempt to measure worker productivity to see if wage differences are justified. This may be because the data needed to measure productivity are difficult to obtain. This paper tests for wage discrimination by gender and race by estimating relative productivity from 2002 Census of Manufacturing data linked to demographic information on workers from Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) files.

This study hopes to fill this gap by investigating how the firm's compensation structure, an important strategic decision closely scrutinized by human resource management, affects the mobility and entrepreneurship decisions of its employees, particularly those employees at the extreme ends of the performance distribution. Using a comprehensive U.S. Census data set covering all employees in the legal services industry across ten states for fifteen years, we find that high performing employees are less likely to leave firms with highly dispersed compensation structures. However, if high performers do leave employers that offer highly disperse compensation structures, they are more likely to join new firms. Less talented employees, on the other hand, are more likely to leave firms with greater pay dispersion. Unlike high performers, we find that low performers are less likely to move to new ventures when departing firms with highly disperse compensation structures.",2010,2010-01-01,27,Seth Carnahan; Rajshree Agarwal; Benjamin A.

Existing empirical assessments typically rely on industry or macro data, obscuring heterogeneity among firms. In this article, we analyze micro panel data from the U.S. Economic Census since 1982 and document empirical patterns to assess a new interpretation of the fall in the labor share based on the rise of “superstar firms.” If globalization or technological changes push sales toward the most productive firms in each industry, product market concentration will rise as industries become increasingly dominated by superstar firms, which have high markups and a low labor share of value added. We empirically assess seven predictions of this hypothesis: (i) industry sales will increasingly concentrate in a small number of firms; (ii) industries where concentration rises most will have the largest declines in the labor share; (iii) the fall in the labor share will be driven largely by reallocation rather than a fall in the unweighted mean labor share across all firms; (iv) the between-firm reallocation component of the fall in the labor share will be greatest in the sectors with the largest increases in market concentration; (v) the industries that are becoming more concentrated will exhibit faster growth of productivity; (vi) the aggregate markup will rise more than the typical firm’s markup; and (vii) these patterns should be observed not only in U.S. firms but also internationally. We find support for all of these predictions.",2020,2020-01-30,1534,David Autor; David Dorn; Lawrence F.

Therefore, knowing the wage and firm size distribution of low-wage workers and how employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) characteristics vary by these dimensions is particularly important for understanding the extent to which low-wage workers and their employers may be affected by different provisions in the ACA. To inform this issue, the authors use data from the 2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey—Insurance Component to examine offers of coverage and cost-sharing requirements by the wage distribution and firm size dimensions of employers. They also draw on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey household-level data to describe the household circumstances of low-wage workers.

Seventy percent of this increase is due to the growth of “superstar” firms - the largest one percent of wholesalers. Estimates based on detailed administrative data show that the rise of the largest firms was driven by an intuitive linkage between their sourcing of goods from abroad and an expansion of their domestic distribution network to reach more buyers. Both elements require scale economies and lead to increased wholesaler market shares and markups. Counterfactual analysis shows that despite increases in wholesaler market power and markups, scale has benefits.

Insurance agents and brokers play a significant role in helping employers navigate these problems. However, little is known about the relations between the structure of the agent/broker market and access and affordability of insurance. This article aims to fill this gap by investigating the influence of agents/brokers on health insurance offering decisions of small firms, which are particularly vulnerable to problems of financing health insurance. Using a unique membership database from the National Association of Health Underwriters together with a nationally representative survey of employers, we find that small firms in more competitive agent/broker markets are more likely to offer health insurance and at lower premiums. Moreover, premiums are less dispersed in more competitive agent/broker markets.",2016,2016-12-06,14,Pinar Karaca‐Mandic; Roger Feldman; Peter Graven,University of Minnesota; National Bureau of Economic Research; Twin Cities Orthopedics; University of Minnesota; Oregon Health & Science University,Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Insurance and Financial Risk Management,Journal of Risk & Insurance,12,"Karaca‐Mandic, Pinar; Feldman, Roger; Graven, Peter. 2016.

We decompose metropolitan segregation into three components: segregation within the city, within the suburbs, and between the city and its suburbs. We then show that extreme levels of segregation were well established in most cities by 1940, and they changed only modestly by 1970. In this period, changes in segregation were greater at the metropolitan scale, driven by racially selective population growth in the suburbs. We also examine major sources of rising segregation, including region, metropolitan total, and Black population sizes, and indicators of redlining in the central cities based on risk maps prepared by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) in the late 1930s. In addition to overall regional differences, segregation between the city and suburbs and within suburbia increased more in metropolitan areas with larger Black populations, but this relationship was found only in the North. In contrast to some recent theorizing, there is no association between preparation of an HOLC risk map or the share of city neighborhoods that were redlined and subsequent change in any component of segregation.",2023,2023-01-27,11,John Logan; Samuel Kye; H.

We found that counties exposed to higher volumes of local insurance advertisements during the first open enrollment period experienced larger reductions in their uninsurance rates than other counties.

The greater turbulence following macro shocks may benefit decentralized firms because the value of local information increases (the “localist” view). On the other hand, the need to make tough decisions may favor centralized firms (the “centralist” view). Using two large micro datasets on decentralization in firms in ten OECD countries (WMS) and US establishments (MOPS administrative data), we find that firms that delegated more power from the central headquarters to local plant managers prior to the Great Recession outperformed their centralized counterparts in sectors that were hardest hit by the subsequent crisis (as measured by export growth and product durability). Results based on measures of turbulence based on product churn and stock market volatility provide further support to the localist view. This conclusion is robust to alternative explanations such as managerial fears of bankruptcy and changing coordination costs. Although decentralization will be suboptimal in many environments, it does appear to be beneficial for the average firm during bad times.

This paper examines whether the allure of new destinations persisted in the 2000s with a particular focus on the internal migration of the foreign born during the recent deep recessionary period and its aftermath. Three specific questions motivate the analysis. First, are immigrants, much like the US-born population, becoming less migratory within the country over time? Second, is immigrant dispersal from traditional gateways via internal migration continuing despite considerable economic contraction in many new destination metropolitan areas? Third, is immigration from aboard a substitute for what appears to be declining immigrant internal migration to new destinations? The findings reveal a close correlation between the declining internal migration propensity of the US-born and immigrants in the last two decades. We also observe parallels between the geographies of migration of native- and foreign-born populations with both groups moving to similar metropolitan areas in the 1990s. This redistributive association, however, weakened in the subsequent decade as new destination metropolitan areas lost their appeal for both groups, especially immigrants. There is no evidence to suggest that immigration from abroad is substituting for the decline in immigrant redistribution through internal migration to new destinations. Across destination types the relationship between immigration from abroad and the internal migration of the foreign born remained the same before, during, and after the Great Recession.",2014,2014-03-01,49,Mark Ellis; Richard Wright; Matthew Townley,University of Washington; Dartmouth College; Dartmouth Hospital; University of Washington,"Migration and Labor Dynamics; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",International Migration Review,03,"Ellis, Mark; Wright, Richard; Townley, Matthew. 2014.

Using longitudinal establishment-level data from the Census, I find that longrun employment and payroll per worker around universities rise particularly rapidly after Bayh-Dole in industries more closely related to local university innovative strengths. The impact of university innovation increases with geographic proximity to the university. Counties surrounding universities that received more pre-Bayh-Dole federal funding - particularly from the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health - experienced faster employment growth after the law. Entering establishments - in particular multi-unit firm expansions - over the period from 1977 to 1997 were especially important in generating long-run employment growth, while incumbents experienced modest declines, consistent with creative destruction.

Institutions ought to matter because they regulate transaction costs, which, in principle, determine whether or not diversity offers advantages or disadvantages. We exploit longitudinal linked employer–employee data for the United States to test this idea, and we triangulate across two measures that differently capture the inclusiveness of urban institutions. Findings offer support for the hypothesis. In cities with low levels of inclusive institutions, the benefits of diversity are modest and in some cases nonexistent; in cities with high levels of inclusive institutions, the benefits of immigrant diversity are positive, significant, and substantial. We also find that weakly inclusive institutions hurt natives considerably more than foreign-born workers. These results confirm the economic significance of immigrant diversity, while suggesting the importance of local social and economic institutions.",2017,2017-03-30,33,Thomas Kemeny; Abigail M.

Design/methodology/approach Two-sample two-stage least squares is used to apply determinants of six different measures of social capital from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey to observations in the Decennial Census (DC) which are then aggregated to the census tract level. The probability of a census tract having a high level of each social capital measure is estimated. Multivariate regression is used to identify the importance of high community social capital for predicting census mail-in return rates. Findings The analysis reveals that a higher level of trust contributes the most to increasing return rates and a high level of political activism decreases return rates. Additionally, higher levels of sociability contribute negatively to DC return rates, which is consistent with sociability being linked to a more insular (i.e. family and friends) focus. Practical implications While contributing statistically significantly to the predictability of census tract response rates, the cost of acquiring measures of social capital for each census tract may not to be viewed worth the gain in predictive power. Social implications Higher levels of trust contribute positively to survey participation, suggesting that any social, economic or political environment that diminishes trust will undercut civic engagement. Political activism and (insular) sociability decrease participation.

Substantial literature across the social sciences has explored the scale and predictors of household mobility as well as changes in metropolitan residential segregation over time. This study unifies these two strands of inquiry by connecting the sorting of households across neighborhoods to aggregate changes in segregation levels. Using discrete choice models of intrametropolitan mobility and restricted decennial census and American Community Survey data for 1960–2014, I model the correlates of household mobility and identify the counterfactual scenarios under which lower segregation levels can be achieved.

This approach allows me to use standardization and components analysis to quantitatively assess the separate contributions that differences in social characteristics and differences in rates of return make towards determining the overall disparity in residential outcomes – that is, the level of segregation – between Whites and Latinos. Based on our micro-level residential attainment analyses we find that for Latinos, acculturation and gains in socioeconomic status are associated with greater residential contact with Whites, in agreement with spatial assimilation theory, which promotes lower segregation. However, our standardization and components analyses reveals that a substantial portion of White-Latino disparities in residential contact with Whites can be attributed to differences in rates of return; that is White-Latino differences in the ability to translate acculturation and gains in socioeconomic status into more residential contact with Whites. This is further elaborated upon by assessing the changes in contact with Whites for Whites and Latinos after manipulating single variables while holding all others constant. This can be interpreted as the role of discrimination which is emphasized by place stratification theory. Therefore we conclude that while members of minority groups make gains in residential outcomes that reduce segregation by attaining parity with Whites on social characteristics as spatial assimilation theory would predict, a substantial disparity will persist as Latinos cannot translate those gains into greater contact with Whites at the rate that Whites can. At the aggregate level of analysis, this means that White-Latino segregation remains substantial even when groups are equalized on social and economic characteristics.",2016,2016-01-01,0,Amber Fox Crowell; Mark Fossett,"California State University, Fresno; Mitchell Institute; Texas A&M University","Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; School Choice and Performance; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Crowell, Amber Fox; Fossett, Mark. 2016.

Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series, including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open.

The question seems central to understanding why some employers and some jobs are “good,” whereas others are not and, more generally, for understanding employment security. The arguments herein use national probability data to examine this question and find that the retraining option is associated with preserving the social capital among current employees. Employers who make greater use of work systems that rely on social capital are more likely to retrain their workers. Alternative explanations—that retraining is an employee benefit associated with employee‐friendly policies or is part of overall strategy to invest in training—receive no support. These results extend our understanding of the role that social capital can play in organizations. They also suggest that being a “good” employer may have a great deal to do with other choices about systems of work organization.",2004,2004-03-25,25,Peter Cappelli,Carnegie Mellon University; Russell Sage Foundation,Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Labor Movements and Unions; Employment and Welfare Studies,Industrial Relations A Journal of Economy and Society,03,"Cappelli, Peter. 2004.

Secondly, it estimates a residential choice model to examine the housing and neighbourhood preferences of the households making such moves. Thirdly, it explores responses to survey questions about residential choices. Evidence is found that, in the US, households who place less value on neighbourhood services and those who face greater constraints on their choices are more likely to make an RLIN move. No evidence is found that households making RLIN moves are choosing neighbourhoods that are more accessible to employment. Rather, it is found that households making RLIN moves appear to place less weight on neighbourhood amenities than other households and more weight on housing costs.",2013,2013-02-15,19,Ingrid Gould Ellen; Keren Mertens Horn; Katherine M.

This paper demonstrates conceptually and empirically the importance of ""trade-induced horizontal inequality,"" i.e. inequality that occurs among workers with the same level of earnings before the trade shock. This type of inequality does not affect the income distribution but generates winners and losers at all income levels. To quantify the horizontal inequality and changes in the income distribution induced by trade in a data-driven way, we develop a characterization of the welfare impacts, governed by simple and intuitive statistics of labor market and consumption exposure to trade. In the U.S., we find substantial heterogeneity in exposure and thus in the welfare effects of trade shocks across workers. Over 99% of the variance of welfare changes from trade shocks arises within income deciles.

The productivity growth has been relatively stronger in those countries and sectors that relied more on competitive devaluations to regain price competitiveness before the euro was adopted. This finding is confirmed by an analysis of firm-level data from the Italian manufacturing sector. This study finds that low-tech businesses, which arguably benefited most from devaluations, have been restructuring more since the adoption of the euro.

The extent of redistribution depends on how both the accumulation phase and the payout phase are designed. The demographic groups with lower average life expectancies will fare poorly under an annuity rule that dictates the employment of a single annuity conversion factor, or a single price, for all individuals of the same age. Setting a higher assumed interest rate will lead in less redistribution from high mortality rate groups to lower mortality groups. Any pricing scheme that tries to consider mortality heterogeneity by pricing based on group characteristics will make some individuals even worse off. Allowing preretirement bequests may be a significant element in decreasing the extent of regressive redistribution. The degree of dispersion in the MW ratios is very sensitive to the precise structure of the annuity program.",2002,2002-01-01,60,Jeffrey R.

Prior experience in the specific industry predicts much greater rates of entrepreneurial success.

IntroductionA leading proximate explanation for plunging employment during the Great Recession is plummeting demand for goods. According to this Keynesian labor demand hypothesis, when producers face unexpectedly low demand for their goods they respond by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. The underlying source of Keynesian labor demand could be nominal price stickiness and/or countercyclical desired markups. See Keynes (1939) for his embrace of both justifications.1We test for Keynesian labor demand across US industries in recent decades (1990 to 2011). To do so, we exploit how durability varies across seventy consumption and investment categories to predict relative goods demand movements over the business cycle. Relative demand shocks allow us to test whether markups move in the direction predicted by Keynesian labor demand.2 We also exploit information on which goods are luxuries versus necessities to predict relative demand, and take into account how price flexibility and capital-intensity of production vary across industries.According to consumer theory, durability should be a powerful determinant of the cyclical expenditures on a good. The more durable a good, the smaller is the average flow of expenditures on the good relative to the accumulated stock. For a good that lasts N years, increasing the stock by 1 percent requires an N percent increase in expenditures on the good relative to replacement expenditures. Thus any common macro shock (such as to technology or monetary policy) should hit demand for durables more dramatically. Similarly, demand for luxuries should be more cyclical than demand for necessities.Under sticky prices, firms should accommodate shifts in relative demand by firing or hiring workers rather than adjusting their prices. If capital is less flexible than labor in the short run, firms in flexible-price industries should adjust their prices more and adjust their production less than do sticky-price industries—controlling for the size of the demand shift they face. If target markups are countercyclical, however, then price stickiness may not be essential for a Keynesian labor demand response to goods demand shocks.We test for Keynesian labor demand using a variety of data. We use US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and insurance industry estimates of durability for seventy goods covering around 60 percent of GDP. These include most consumer and investment goods and services, but exclude government purchases and housing consumption. We estimate whether a good is a luxury or a necessity using cross-sectional Engel curves from the US Consumer Expenditure Survey. We assess price flexibility using US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) microdata on the frequency of price changes by good.We use quarterly NIPA data on consumption and investment from 1990 to 2011 to test whether durability and luxuriousness succeed in predicting the cyclicality of expenditures. Durability is a strong predictor. Bringing in data from the US Current Employment Survey, we find that durability is also highly correlated with employment growth across industries—including during the Great Recession. Finally, we incorporate the US Bureau of Labor Statistics KLEMS data on production, prices, and inputs across detailed industries. This allows us to contrast movements in labor’s productivity with its real wage, identifying whether producers move away from constant-markup labor demand in response to goods demand shocks.We find that industries producing goods that are more durable, while displaying much more cyclical employment and output, exhibit countercyclical relative markups. This countercyclical increase in markups is sufficiently large that relative prices of durables do not fall in recessions. (By contrast, sectoral total factor productivity [TFP] movements play little role in explaining the lack of cyclicality in durables’ relative prices.) Our evidence rejects flexible-price labor demand under a constant markup, but is consistent with Keynesian labor demand. This cyclical pricing for durables could reflect intentional markup movements, rather than being the byproduct of price stickiness. In fact, a model with countercyclical intended markups for durables, but flexible pricing in general, would arguably explain the data better than a sticky-price model.Despite its prominence in business cycle theorizing, there have been surprisingly few tests for Keynesian labor demand. Most have been based on aggregate time series, such as Galí and Rabanal (2004) and Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006). More recently, a number of studies have exploited regional variation to test whether goods demand drives employment. Examples include Feyrer and Sacerdote (2011), Nakamura and Steinsson (2011), and Mian and Sufi(2012). Mulligan (2010) looks at seasonal movements in labor supply and employment. Our study complements these by looking at cross-industry evidence. Thus, our approach is similar to Shea (1993) and Nekarda and Ramey (2011), who examine the impact of an industry’s downstream demand (Shea) and its share of government purchases (Nekarda and Ramey) on industry price and quantity. Chang, Hornstein, and Sarte (2009) examine how employment responds to industry-specific productivity shocks, and how that response depends on the use of inventories and pricing frequency in the industry.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II, we lay out a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to illustrate the key forces that motivate our demand predictors. Section III briefly describes the data sets we use. Section IV presents the main results, and section V concludes.II. ModelIn this section we use a multisector DSGE model to demonstrate how relative demand shocks affect markups under Keynesian versus classical labor demand. Here the source of Keynesian labor demand is sticky prices, rather than countercyclical intended markups. We incorporate heterogeneity in the durability of goods, the capital intensity of firms’ production, and the frequency of price changes. After sketching the key model features, we use a simplified version of the model to illustrate analytically how movements in relative quantities and prices across sectors differ depending on whether the model is Keynesian or classical (i.e., sticky or flexible prices).3 We then calibrate and simulate the full-blown model to get some quantitative sense of these movements.A. FirmsDurable (Yd) and nondurable (Yn) final goods are produced from intermediate goods, which are produced by two types of firms: those with high- and low-capital-intensity technologies. Competitive final goods producers use the following production functionwhere Yjf,t are composite intermediate goods produced (by competitive firms) according towhere ε > 1. Individual intermediate goods producers are monopolistically competitive and produce using a constant returns to scale (CRS) production functionwhere kjf,t(l) and njf,t(l) are capital and labor services employed by firm l in sector jf at time t, Ajf,t is sector-specific TFP, j = {d,n} indexes the type of good produced, and f = {h,l} denotes the technology used. Sectoral price indices, Pj,t and Pjf,t, expressed as functions of individual prices pjf,t(l), can be derived via standard cost minimization.Capital and labor flow freely between firms in the same sector, which implies, under CRS production, that nominal marginal costs and capital-labor ratios will be equated across firms in the same sector. However, as will become clear when we discuss household supply of factor inputs, imperfect capital mobility will allow marginal costs to vary across sectors. Furthermore, different production technologies across sectors imply different slopes for sectoral marginal cost curves. In particular, firms that produce with more capital-intensive technologies (larger αf) will require a greater increase in the flexible labor factor to effect a given short-run increase in production (i.e., their marginal cost curves are steeper).Finally, goods prices are sticky. We use the Calvo (1983) assumption whereby monopolistically competitive firms change their prices with a constant probability of (1 – θif). We allow θjf to vary by sector, and will also consider perfect price flexibility (θjf = 0, ∀jf ).B. HouseholdsHouseholds get utility from nondurable and durable consumption and disutility from working. Let Cn,t denote nondurable consumption, Cd,t durable consumption expenditures, the stock of the durable consumption good, and Nt labor supply. Households maximize expected discounted utilityand the stock of the durable consumption good evolves according towhere δ is the depreciation rate and S′′ governs adjustment costs on durables expenditures. Following Barsky, House, and Kimball (2007), the functional forms for household preferences arewhere σ is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, ψ determines the relative preference for nondurables versus durables, η is the elasticity of substitution between the two goods, ϕ is the Frisch labor supply elasticity, and χ governs the level of disutility from labor supply.Greater durability implies that any increase in consumption requires a more dramatic increase in expenditure. To increase consumption of the durable good by 1 percent from a steady state level requires an annual increase in expenditure of 1/δ percent, whereas a 1 percent increase in nondurables consumption requires only a 1 percent increase in expenditure. This motivates our use of durability as a shifter of goods demand and, because a larger increase in expenditure will call forth a larger increase in hours worked, labor demand as well.The household also owns the economy’s stock of physical capital (Ks), sets the utilization rate of capital (u), and rents capital services to firms in a competitive market. The relationship between capital services, utilization, and the physical capital stock isThe accumulation equation for capital mirrors that for durables consumption:where Ijf,t denotes investment that adds to the sector-jf capital stock. Note that Ijf,t is distinct from investment expenditures, which are given byInvestment expenditures include maintenance costs arising from capital utilization, . The cost function a(ṡ) is increasing, convex, and zero in steady state. In addition, investment is affected by investment-specific productivity ; greater productivity means less expenditure is required to achieve a given increase in the capital stock.Importantly, we have assumed each sector has a separate capital stock, which means that capital is (partially) fixed in the short run. Capital services can adjust immediately due to time-varying utilization, but utilization costs make utilization less than perfectly flexible. Capital stocks adjust fully over time, but the speed depends on investment adjustment costs.Households also supply labor to firms in each sector, and this process is intermediated by monopolistically competitive unions who have the power to set wages (Erceg, Henderson, and Levin 2000). The unions face Calvo frictions, altering wages with a constant probability of 1 – θw. Because wage stickiness does not vary by sector and labor supply across sectors is assumed to be perfectly elastic (Nt = ∑j,fNjf,t ), (nominal) wages Wt will be equalized across sectors.C. Analytical DiscussionBefore presenting numerical simulations, we use a stripped-down version of our model to analytically illustrate how cyclical movements in relative sector quantities, prices, and markups behave under sticky versus flexible prices. We assume the economy starts in steady state and evaluate the immediate response to an expansionary aggregate shock at time t. The stripped-down model features a constant aggregate capital stock, with the distribution of capital services across sectors fixed at time t but perfectly mobile by t + 1 (fixed capital utilization and no investment adjustment costs). We also assume durables goods are very long-lived (δ sufficiently small that the shadow value of durables is nearly invariant to short-lived shocks, as in Barsky, House, and Kimball 2007).With sufficiently long-lived durables, household optimization requireswhere hatted variables are log deviations from steady-state values. Furthermore, the law of motion for durables implies ; all produced goods are consumed ; the production functions are ; marginal costs are ; and markups are given by . Combining these expressions, we haveWe first consider a flexible-price economy. Markups are constant at μj = ε/(ε – 1). If sectors have the same capital intensities, equation (2) shows that labor will expand more in the durables sector. Thus, relative output, marginal costs, and prices also increase. Note that these relative movements do not depend on the underlying shock causing the expansion, but the movements are even larger if the source is a positive aggregate TFP shock.The results differ under sticky prices. Take the extreme of fixed prices, so that relative prices do not move. Equation (1) implies an increase in relative durables output, and thus labor and marginal costs. Therefore, relative markups are countercyclical. If prices are not perfectly rigid but are equally sticky in the two sectors, one can show that relative output, labor, and prices are procyclical, while relative markups are countercyclical.4 Thus, the primary (qualitative) difference between flexible and sticky prices is the behavior of relative markups.We have derived these predictions for relative movements in durables holding other characteristics—such as price flexibility, capital intensity, and TFP—fixed across sectors. This is important. For example, if durables prices were perfectly flexible and nondurables perfectly rigid, the relative durables markup would be procyclical and, under some parameters, relative labor could be countercyclical. Likewise, if the aggregate expansion was caused by a shock to durables TFP (Ad,t > An,t), one can show that, under sticky prices, the relative durables markup would again be procyclical (e.g., assuming η = 1 and αj = α). In our subsequent empirical analysis, therefore, we will control for variables that might be correlated with durability.So far, we have analyzed the response of durables relative to nondurables, but the model also predicts relative movements across goods on other dimensions, holding durability constant. Optimal demand by final (durable or nondurable) goods producers implieswhere h and l denote high- and low-capital-intensity firms. Assuming equally sticky prices in the two subsectors, one can derive the following expression for relative markupsso that higher-capital-intensity production implies a countercyclical markup. The sign of the relative movements in other variables depends on parameter values, although the more capital-intensive good typically has higher marginal costs and prices, but lower output.We can also use equation (3) to analyze how differences in price stickiness affect relative movements, now letting h and l denote firms with high and low price stickiness. We get the following relationship between relative labor and relative markups:That is, relative labor (and thus output and marginal costs) will move in the opposite direction of relative markups (and prices). Whether the relative markups are procyclical or countercyclical, however, depends on the nature of the underlying shock. Monetary (TFP) shocks that put upward (downward) pressure on prices will lead to countercyclical (procyclical) markups for the sector with stickier prices.D. Quantitative ResultsWe now calibrate and simulate the full-blown model. This allows us to move away from stark assumptions, such as the complete short-run fixity of capital, and consider realistic features like capital utilization and investment adjustment costs. We consider an empirically relevant amount of durability, capital intensity, and price stickiness in order to get a quantitative sense of the size of movements of key variables across sectors.Table 1 summarizes our model calibration. The parameters governing household preferences (σ, η, ϕ) and desired markups are set to standard values, and y is set to produce a steady-state nondurable-to-durable consumption ratio of 2.96. The annual depreciation rate of 5 percent matches the (weighted) average life span of durables in our data (i.e., twenty years). We set the household’s annual discount rate (3.34 percent) to match an investment-to-output ratio of 0.16, given the depreciation rate and an empirical aggregate capital share of 0.322. When we consider high- and low-capital intensity sectors, we use capital shares of ah = 0.475 and al = 0.169, which are the weighted average capital shares for consumption categories above and below the median capital share, respectively. Consistent with the microdata underlying the US CPI, the average price changes every four months, while high- and low-frequency firms set prices roughly every two and a half and twelve months. Wages are assumed to change once a year.Table 1. Model ParametersView Table ImageThe curvature of the utilization adjustment cost function is pinned down by the relationship between relative sector utilization rates and relative labor-to-capital ratios:Using Gorodnichenko and Shapiro (2011) data on twenty two-digit manufacturing sectors over the past thirty years, we regress utilization rates on labor-capital ratios (and time effects) to estimate an elasticity of 0.33, corresponding to a′′ = 2.0. Online appendix C has details (http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/c12756/appendix.pdf). For durables expenditure adjustment costs we set S′′ = 0.455/δ to match Cooper and Haltiwanger’s (2006) estimate of the elasticity of the investment rate with respect to Tobin’s Q.Finally, we need to calibrate the exogenous shock processes and the Taylor rule that governs monetary policy. With one exception, these parameters are monthly transformations of the quarterly estimates of Smets–Wouters (2007).5 We choose a larger volatility for the neutral technology shock to match the cyclicality of the aggregate labor share (i.e., inverse markup), but since our primary focus is on conditional impulse response functions, alternative calibrations of the volatility do not change the insights we draw from the model.Figures 1 to 4 show impulse responses to an expansionary monetary policy shock.6 We plot relative movements in output, labor, prices, and markups, where we measure markups using the inverse of the labor share. (Note that, under Cobb–Douglas production, fluctuations in markups are equivalent to fluctuations in the labor share. However, our test does not hinge on Cobb–Douglas production, and we will explicitly consider departures from it in our empirical analysis.) For scaling purposes, we also show the response of aggregate output (thin line). Figure 1 shows the relative durable-to-nondurable responses under sticky prices. For this exercise, the average capital intensity and price-change frequency in the two sectors are the same.7 Relative output (thick solid line) and labor (dashed line) are strongly procyclical, while the relative price response (dashed-dotted line) is also positive but muted by sticky prices. Relative markups (dotted line) are countercyclical, reflecting two forces: first and most important, price markups are more countercyclical for durables firms than for nondurables firms; second, within each sector the more labor-intensive subsector will gain market share because it has more flexibility to ramp up production. This composition effect will cause the labor share of both sectors to increase (decreasing the measured markup), but will be stronger for durables as their expenditures increase more.Fig. 1.

Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointThe immediate relative markup response is about 25 percent that of relative output, while the relative labor response is 25 percent greater than the output response. With wages equalized across sectors, . These magnitudes are, of course, dependent on our calibration. If the cost of varying capital utilization was zero (infinite), the relative labor response would be the same as (50 percent greater than) the relative output response.Figure 2 repeats the same exercise but with flexible prices in both sectors. (Note that wages are still sticky.) The monetary shock has smaller real effects under flexible prices; the aggregate output response is about 70 percent as big as the response under sticky prices. The relative price of durables now increases more, muting the shift in goods and labor demand toward durables. The relative markup response is nearly zero, with the small discrepancy solely reflecting the aforementioned composition effect.Fig. 2.

We once again allow for sticky prices, as in figure 1, but consider lowand high-price flexibility subsectors (1 – θl = 0.08, 1 –θl = 0.42) and focus on movements within the durables sector. The subsector with less price flexibility will exhibit a more sluggish price response, decreasing its relative price and increasing its relative output, labor input, and marginal costs. Thus, firms whose prices respond more slowly (on average) to the monetary shock see their relative markups decline. The magnitude of the relative markup movement is almost half the magnitude of the relative output response.Fig. 3.

In response to an expansionary shock, firms with more capital-intensive technologies face steeper marginal cost curves. Although their relative markup decreases (as shown analytically), their higher marginal costs lead to a higher relative price and lower relative output. Note that the magnitude of the markup response is greater than the output response because the initial relative labor response is positive under our calibration, although this result is quite sensitive to the capital-intensity gap (ah – al) and fixity of the capital stock. At any rate, the relative labor response is more muted than under flexible prices, where markups are constant and the higher marginal costs of high-capital-intensity firms are completely passed through into relative prices, resulting in a larger decrease in relative output and a decrease in relative hours.Fig. 4. Relative high/low capital intensity response, sticky pricesNotes: Impulse response to monetary policy shock. Variable Y is output, N labor, P prices, and μ markups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointTo recap, the Keynesian labor demand hypothesis is that firms respond to unexpectedly low demand for their goods by laying off workers rather than lowering their output prices. Equivalently, if marginal cost curves are upward sloping, firms increase their markups. In this section we have considered one possible source of this behavior—nominal price stickiness—and have shown that the relative markups of more durable and more capital-intensive goods are (essentially) constant under flexible prices but countercyclical under sticky prices.8 In our empirical analysis, we will exploit variation across different types of goods to test this prediction of Keynesian labor demand.The model is also helpful for clarifying why we do not simply examine the cyclicality of the aggregate markup in the data. The reason is that, even under sticky prices, the aggregate markup can be uncorrelated with output. This is what happens, for example, in the Smets–Wouters (2007) model estimated on US data. The reason is that the aggregate markup responds positively to some expansionary shocks but negatively to others. We demonstrate this in figures 5 and 6, which show impulse responses to all four aggregate shocks in our DSGE model. We scale the shocks to have the same initial effect on aggregate output (figure 5), while figure 6 shows the different aggregate markup responses to the various shocks. Of course, one could address this by conditioning on particular aggregate shocks à la Galí (1999). But we pursue a different, complementary approach of examining how relative markups respond to relative demand shocks across industries.Fig. 5.

Evidence on Durability and the Cyclicality of ExpendituresWe now construct demand predictors across industries. We start with the BLS’s classification of goods in the CPI into seventy Expenditure Classes (ECs). (See appendix 6 in http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch17.pdf.) We combine four pairs of ECs and drop five others due to missing NIPA data or overlap with NIPA investment categories, leaving us with sixty-one consumer goods.9 We then add nine categories of investment from NIPA, leaving us with a total of seventy expenditure categories. Online appendix table 1 provides the full list.For each of these seventy categories, we create two demand predictors. The first is based on the good’s durability, and the second is based on the Engel curve slope for the good (i.e., the extent to which the good is a luxury or necessity). We also construct two variables specific to each category that should affect how prices and costs respond to demand: the frequency of price change and the importance of capital versus labor in producing the good.A. DurabilityOf our seventy goods, twenty-eight are classified by NIPA as durable goods (nineteen of the sixty-one consumer goods are durables, and all nine of the investment goods). We use two sources to quantify the durability of the durables. A primary source is life expectancy tables from a major property-casualty insurance company, which we use for seventeen goods. For autos, tires, and the nine investment categories we use estimates from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=10&step=1).Among the twenty-eight durable goods, the extent of durability varies widely. It is over thirty years for residential structures and three types of commercial buildings. For business equipment it ranges from four to eleven years (with information equipment and software at the less durable end, presumably due to obsolescence). Durability also varies among the nineteen consumer durables. At the low end are clothing categories (less than five years) and at the upper end are appliances and electronics (closer to ten years). We classify the remaining forty-two consumption categories as nondurables (i.e., lasting less than a year). These include food and services.B. Engel CurvesWhether a good is a luxury or necessity should also help predict cyclicality of demand. To estimate Engel curves, we turn to the US Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) Interview Surveys. We pool CE crosssections from 1982 to 2010 to estimate Engel elasticities for our sixty-one consumer goods and for housing services.10 The CE Interview Survey lumps together all food for home consumption, so for these categories we estimate a common elasticity.Households are interviewed up to four consecutive quarters on their detailed expenditures. We estimate Engel elasticities by regressing spending on each category from the household’s second through fourth interviews on the sum of its spending during those same three quarters. We instrument for the log of a household’s total expenditures in its final three interviews based on its (logged) total and nondurable expenditures from the first quarterly interview, as well as its (logged) before-tax annual income reported in both the first and final interviews. We instrument to limit attenuation bias from measurement error in household total expenditures. We do not log expenditures for individual categories, the dependent variables in the second stage, as these are zero in some cases. Instead we divide the household’s spending on a category by mean spending on that category across households. Thus our elasticities are relative to mean household spending on that category.11For the nine NIPA i",2013,2013-01-01,35,Mark Bils; Peter J.

We document three results. First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, less than 5% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.",2019,2019-12-20,627,Raj Chetty; Nathaniel Hendren; Maggie R.

Exploiting the cross‐state, cross‐time variation in the timing of branch deregulation, we find that deregulation materially tightened the distribution of income by boosting incomes in the lower part of the income distribution while having little impact on incomes above the median.

State and local governments (SLGs) have strong incentives to consider the economics of such “divestment”; many have particularly large unfunded benefits liabilities. We investigated whether SLGs would save under two scenarios: (1) shifting all employees and under‐65 retirees to alternative sources of coverage and (2) shifting only employees whose household incomes indicate they would be eligible for federally‐subsidized coverage and all under‐65 retirees. Full divestment would cost SLGs more than they currently pay, due primarily to penalty costs.

This article presents a conceptual definition of sprawl based on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity mixed uses, and proximity. Sprawl is defined as a condition of land use that is represented by low values on one or more of these dimensions. Each dimension is operationally defined and tested in 13 urbanized areas. Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.

Horizontal mergers involving plants in close proximity are associated with price increases and decreases in output, but also raise productivity at acquired plants. While there is a significant negative relationship between productivity and prices, the rate at which productivity reduces price is modest and the effects of increased market power are not offset. I then present several additional new results of policy interest. For example, mergers are only observed leading to price increases after the relaxation of antitrust standards in the mid-1980s; price increases following mergers are persistent but tend to become smaller over time; and, there is evidence that firms target plants charging below average prices for acquisition. Finally, I use a simple multinomial logit demand model to assess the effects of merger activity on total welfare. At acquired plants, the consumer and producer surplus effects approximately cancel out, but effects at acquiring plants and non-merging plants, where prices also rise, cause a substantial decrease in consumer surplus.",2015,2015-01-01,8,Robert B.

For businessto-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and interchangeable product items. We argue that our proposed ideal target indexes could greatly reduce these biases and make use of increasingly available electronic scanner data on prices and quantities.

It is very difficult to assemble sufficient cross-sectional and longitudinal variation for large-scale panel exercises. This chapter describes a new approach for quantifying the ethnic composition of U.S. inventors. The study of how U.S. ethnic inventors agglomerate is very important, given the disproportionate contributions of immigrant researchers and their nonrandom spatial distribution across the United States. Such a characterization is necessary for understanding the geography of U.S. innovation and economic growth. Moreover, the spatial variation of immigrant researchers across cities allows for stronger quantitative assessments of the role of innovation in city growth. The chapter also discusses the growing contribution of ethnic inventors to U.S. technology formation and uses the patenting data to calculate concentration indices for U.S. innovation.

The model of household specialization and division of labor introduced by Becker posits that when forming households, couples will exploit the gains from trade by having one spouse specialize in market work while the other specializes in household work. Given the historical advantage of men in the labor market, the model predicts specialization by gender and therefore an earnings advantage for married men and an earnings disadvantage for married women. Is this model of specialization useful for understanding the evolution of the gender gap across generations of women. And what about children? Academic papers have shown that wages of mothers are significantly lower than those of non-mothers with similar human capital characteristics.

We show that male-female and education-wage differentials moved in opposite directions in response to the adoption of PCs.

However, recent theoretical work has posited that the entry decision is an outcome of a learning process and that the information acquired during the pre‐entry period shapes subsequent performance dynamics. We provide the first systematic data on the pre‐entry period using a nationally representative survey. We document the activities that prospective entrants undertake, finding variation according to opportunity costs, prior experience, and confidence levels. Our results suggest the pre‐entry period is shaped by a series of choices by prospective entrants as they contemplate entry, further exploration, or ending the entrepreneurial process. Managerial Summary We created and implemented a nationally representative survey on the entrepreneurial activities of Americans. Several interesting findings emerged. First, approximately a third of Americans report having had a business idea in the past 5 years, motivated in the vast majority of cases by lifestyle concerns rather than the pursuit of significant business opportunities. Fewer than half of those who considered starting a business take even the lowest cost steps, like searching the Internet for potential competitors or speaking with a friend.

We examine this issue using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component with Administrative Records (MEPS-ICAR), a unique employer-employee linked data set that is constructed by matching the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to Internal Revenue Service administrative records and the Decennial Census. Multivariate analyses show that among firms with fewer than 50 workers, the probability that workers receive an insurance offer is positively associated with higher median workforce incomes, and conditional offers of dependent coverage increase when the majority of workers are married or from a family with at least three members.

However, whether the migration pattern and the influential factor have distinctive disparities between hierarchical county pairs is still elusive. This study delves into the spatial diversity and driving forces behind migration patterns at the county level, with a particular focus on the disparities through an examination of migration levels and scales. We utilize county-pair-level migration data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to unveil the intricate network structure of population movement. Our findings reveal a pronounced spatial diversity in migration patterns, while cities witness a net influx of population, and in contrast to rural areas, majority of population inflow of cities primarily stems from metro areas. We employ Hierarchical Linear Models to analyze the impact of social connectedness, local wealthiness, and racial diversity on migration flows. The results highlight that cities with robust social networks, higher economic status, and balanced racial diversity are more attractive to migrants. Notably, the influence of racial diversity differences between origin and destination counties is found to be more significant in attracting migration compared to per capita income disparities. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in managing demographic changes and addressing the challenges associated with migration-driven population redistribution.

Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.

This has lead to attempts to provide explanations—using both standard economic theory and behavioral economics— for why certain individuals may be attracted to such an apparently unprofitable activity. Drawing on research in behavioral economics, in the sections that follow, we review three sets of possible interpretations for understanding the empirical facts related to the entry into, and persistence in, entrepreneurship. Differences in risk aversion provide a plausible and intuitive interpretation of entrepreneurial activity. In addition, a growing literature has begun to highlight the potential importance of overconfidence in driving entrepreneurial outcomes. Such a mechanism may appear at face value to work like a lower level of risk aversion, but there are clear conceptual differences—in particular, overconfidence likely arises from behavioral biases and misperceptions of probability distributions.

Three issues are particularly concerning to us: 1) the very narrow band of technological innovations that fit the requirements of institutional venture capital investors; 2) the relatively small number of venture capital investors who hold and shape the direction of a substantial fraction of capital that is deployed into financing radical technological change; and 3) the relaxation in recent years of the intense emphasis on corporate governance by venture capital firms. While our ability to assess the social welfare impact of venture capital remains nascent, we hope that this article will stimulate discussion of and research into these questions.",2020,2020-08-01,311,Josh Lerner; Ramana Nanda,National Bureau of Economic Research; National Bureau of Economic Research,Private Equity and Venture Capital; Corporate Finance and Governance; Entrepreneurship Studies and Influences,The Journal of Economic Perspectives,08,"Lerner, Josh; Nanda, Ramana. 2020.

At present, the tax code does not allow families who provide this financial relief an income tax deduction, even though such relief is a gift to governments for exclusively public purposes and thus is analogous to a charitable donation. Using the Public Use Microdata Sample of the American Community Survey and the NBER Internet Taxsim calculator, this paper estimates that granting families who enroll their children in private schools an income tax deduction equal to the per-pupil expenditures in their public school district would cost the federal government an average of $7.75 billion per year over the 2006–10 period. This amount is less than 1% of federal income tax revenues. Because private school enrollment, public school expenditures, the likelihood of itemization, and marginal tax rates increase with taxpayer income, the dollar benefits of this change are positively related to income. At the margin, high-income taxpayers would receive about 35 cents in federal and state tax relief for each dollar of per-pupil expenditures forgone.",2013,2013-08-01,3,Andrew Samwick,Dartmouth College; Dartmouth Hospital,"Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",Tax Policy and the Economy,08,"Samwick, Andrew. 2013.

Exploiting the rapid diffusion of the internet in the United States, we assess the sensitivity of production chain organization to this innovation in IT access and use. Extending theories of the firm that recognize the importance of downstream transfers (selling as opposed to sourcing) and plural governance in organizational design, we predict IT-driven shifts in downstream vertical integration. In a detailed panel of Census Bureau data for over 5,600 manufacturing plants, we observe the extent of a production unit’s downstream transactions within the firm alongside concurrent sales to external customers—a mix we refer to as plural selling. Our main finding is that the use of the internet for external coordination precipitated a significant decline in downstream vertical integration across the manufacturing sector. Instrumental variables estimation points to a causal relationship but also heterogeneous treatment effects. Key drivers of plural organization, such as complementarities and constraints across differently governed transactions, help explain such heterogeneity, as does concurrent use of internal production management IT. Our study is the first study to leverage a plural governance framework and large-scale microdata to understand how U.S. production chain organization shifted in response to this rapid and far-reaching technological change.

The opening of these markets has led to the establishment of hundreds of cannabis production and retail firms with accompanying demand for labor, leading to concerns about spillover effects on wages from incumbents.We study the markets for agricultural and retail labor in Washington and Colorado from 2000 to 2019 using differences-in-differences with synthetic controls. We employ employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, state-level demographic data from the US Census Bureau, and agricultural data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service. We use the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for variable selection and classification and regression trees (CART) for chained imputation of missing values.We find little-to-no evidence of a significant difference in weekly wages per worker generated by cannabis legalization: the log of the weekly wage per worker decreases by 0.013 in Washington's agricultural sector (p value 0.091) and increases by 0.059 in Washington's retail sector (p value 0.606).

The Electoral Consequences of Rising Trade Exposure,"Has rising import competition contributed to the polarization of US politics? Analyzing multiple measures of political expression and results of congressional and presidential elections spanning the period 2000 through 2016, we find strong though not definitive evidence of an ideological realignment in trade-exposed local labor markets that commences prior to the divisive 2016 US presidential election. Exploiting the exogenous component of rising import competition by China, we find that trade exposed electoral districts simultaneously exhibit growing ideological polarization in some domains, meaning expanding support for both strong-left and strong-right views, and pure rightward shifts in others. Specifically, trade-impacted commuting zones or districts saw an increasing market share for the Fox News channel (a rightward shift), stronger ideological polarization in campaign contributions (a polarized shift), and a relative rise in the likelihood of electing a Republican to Congress (a rightward shift). Trade-exposed counties with an initial majority White population became more likely to elect a GOP conservative, while trade-exposed counties with an initial majority-minority population became more likely to elect a liberal Democrat, where in both sets of counties, these gains came at the expense of moderate Democrats (a polarized shift). In presidential elections, counties with greater trade exposure shifted toward the Republican candidate (a rightward shift). These results broadly support an emerging political economy literature that connects adverse economic shocks to sharp ideological realignments that cleave along racial and ethnic lines and induce discrete shifts in political preferences and economic policy.

The SPM has advantages over the official poverty measure, including a more defensible adjustment for family size and composition, an expanded definition of the family unit that includes cohabitors, and a definition of income that is conceptually closer to resources available for consumption. The SPM's definition of income, though conceptually broader than pre-tax money income, is difficult to implement given available data and their accuracy. Furthermore, income data do not capture consumption out of savings and tangible assets such as houses and cars. A consumption-based measure has similar advantages but fewer disadvantages. We compare those added to and dropped from the poverty rolls by the alternative measures relative to the current official measure. We find that the SPM adds to poverty individuals who are more likely to be college graduates, own a home and a car, live in a larger housing unit, have air conditioning, health insurance, and substantial assets, and have other more favorable characteristics than those who are dropped from poverty. Meanwhile, we find that a consumption measure compared to the official measure or the SPM adds to the poverty rolls individuals who are more disadvantaged than those who are dropped. We decompose the differences between the SPM and official poverty and find that the most problematic aspect of the SPM is the subtraction of medical out-of-pocket expenses from SPM income.

We use a model of endogenous offshoring to characterize this simultaneity and to derive an instrumental variables strategy allowing us to estimate the impact of offshore hiring on domestic employment. Our IV strategy exploits variation in offshoring costs across countries, industries, and time that results from the implementation of bilateral tax treaties, and uses Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) firm-level data for U.S. multinationals across two decades. We confirm that new treaties are unrelated to existing employment trends, and proceed to estimate the effects of offshoring on U.S. employment within multinational firms, industry-wide, and within local labor markets. We find that a 10 percent increase in foreign affiliate employment increases domestic U.S. employment for existing multinational firms by 1.4 percent, consistent with increased scale of production following a decline in global production costs. However, industry-wide U.S. employment increases by only one-third as much, as the opening of new offshore production facilities generates substitution for workers that had been hired domestically. We estimate slightly larger effects for local labor markets, suggesting there are possible spillovers across industries in the same location. Throughout the analysis, OLS estimates, which fail to account for the simultaneity of domestic and offshore employment, are more than 3 times larger than the preferred IV estimates. Overall, our results indicate that greater offshore activity raises net employment by U.S. firms.",2017,2017-01-01,9,Brian K.

Design We estimate a difference‐in‐difference‐in‐differences model to separately identify the effects of the nationwide and Medicaid expansion portions of the ACA using the methodology developed in the recent ACA literature. The differences come from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre‐ ACA uninsured rates. In order to focus on access disparities, we stratify our sample separately by income, race/ethnicity, marital status, age, gender, and geography. Principal Findings After three years, the fully implemented ACA eliminated 43% of the coverage gap across income groups, with the Medicaid expansion accounting for this entire reduction. The ACA also reduced coverage disparities across racial groups by 23%, across marital status by 46%, and across age‐groups by 36%, with these changes being partly attributable to both the Medicaid expansion and nationwide components of the law.

While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",2019,2019-03-25,503,Morgan R.

We build on recent evidence of a cyclical job ladder that reallocates workers from low-productivity to high-productivity firms through job-to-job moves. In this paper, we turn to the question of who moves up this job ladder and the implications for worker sorting across firms. Not surprisingly, we find that job-to-job moves reallocate younger workers disproportionately from less productive to more productive firms. More surprisingly, especially in the context of the recent literature on assortative matching with on-the-job search, we find that job-to-job moves disproportionately reallocate less educated workers up the job ladder. This finding holds even though we find that more educated workers are more likely to work with more productive firms. We find that while highly educated workers are less likely to match to low-productivity firms, they are also less likely to separate from them, with less educated workers more likely to separate to a better employer in expansions and to be shaken off the ladder (separate to nonemployment) in contractions. Our findings underscore the cyclical role job-to-job moves play in matching workers to better-paying employers.",2017,2017-12-20,39,John Haltiwanger; Henry R.

To what extent do race and/or Hispanic origin responses change? Is change more common to/from some race/ethnic groups than others? Does the propensity to change responses vary by characteristics of the individual? To what extent do these changes affect researchers? We use internal Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which individuals’ responses have been linked across years. Approximately 9.8 million people (about 6 percent) in our large, non-representative linked data have a different race and/or Hispanic origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Several groups experienced considerable fluidity in racial identification: American Indians and Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and multiple-race response groups, as well as Hispanics when reporting a race. In contrast, race and ethnic responses for single-race non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians were relatively consistent over the decade, as were ethnicity responses by Hispanics. People who change their race and/or Hispanic origin response(s) are doing so in a wide variety of ways, as anticipated by previous research. For example, people’s responses change from multiple races to a single race, from a single race to multiple races, from one single race to another, and some people add or drop a Hispanic response. The inflow of people to each race/Hispanic group is in many cases similar in size to the outflow from the same group, such that cross-sectional data would show a small net change. We find response changes across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with variation across groups.

The way outsiders describe non-strangers in terms of their race and Hispanic origin may reveal popular assumptions about which race/Hispanic categories are salient for Americans, which kinds of people are seen as multiracial, and the types of cues people use when identifying another person’s race. We study patterns of observer identification using a unique, large, linked data source with two measures of a person’s race and Hispanic origin. One measure (from Census 2000 or the 2010 Census) was provided by a household respondent and the other (from the other census year) was provided by a census proxy reporter (e.g., a neighbor) who responded on behalf of a non-responsive household. We ask: Does an outsider’s report of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match a household report? We find that in about 90% of our 3.7 million (nonrepresentative) cases, proxy reports of a person’s race and Hispanic origin match responses given by the household in a different census year. Match rates are high for the largest groups: non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Asians and for Hispanics, though proxies are not very able to replicate the race responses of Hispanics. Matches are much less common for people in smaller groups (American Indian/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, Some Other Race, and multiracial). We also ask: What predicts a matched response and what predicts a particular unmatched response? We find evidence of the persistence of hypodescent for blacks and hyperdescent for American Indians. Biracial Asian-whites and Pacific Islander-whites are more often seen by others as non-Hispanic white than as people of color. Proxy reporters tend to identify children as multiple race and elders as single race, whether they are or not. The race/Hispanic composition of the tract is more powerfully predictive of a particular unmatched response than are tract-level measures of socioeconomic status; unmatched responses are often consistent with the race/Hispanic characteristics of the neighborhood.",2017,2017-01-11,1,Sonya Rastogi; CAROLYN LIEBLER; James Noon,University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota System; United States Census Bureau; University of Minnesota; United States Census Bureau,"Social and Intergroup Psychology; Racial and Ethnic Identity Research; Names, Identity, and Discrimination Research",,01,"Rastogi, Sonya; LIEBLER, CAROLYN; Noon, James. 2017.

This paper explores whether a more comprehensive treatment of globalization can help. CPI inflation has become more synchronized around the world since the 2008 crisis, but core and wage inflation have become less synchronized. Global factors (including commodity prices, world slack, exchange rates, and global value chains) are significant drivers of CPI inflation in a cross-section of countries, and their role has increased over the last decade, particularly the role of nonfuel commodity prices. These global factors, however, do less to improve our understanding of core and wage inflation. Key results are robust to using a less-structured trend-cycle decomposition instead of a Phillips curve framework, with the set of global variables more important for understanding the cyclical component of inflation over the last decade but not the underlying slow-moving inflation trend. Domestic slack still plays a role for all the inflation measures, although globalization has caused some ""flattening"" of this relationship, especially for CPI inflation. Although CPI inflation is increasingly determined abroad, core and wage inflation are still largely domestic processes.",2019,2019-01-01,59,Kristin J.

While publicly listed firms benefit from a lower cost of capital, enabling increased focus on commercialization and profitability, they are less suited to pursue long-term risky investments. Privately held firms are better equipped to pursue innovative projects but face a higher cost of capital, which limits their growth. Complementarities between public and private equity markets can mitigate their respective limitations. Innovation in private equity markets supplements commercialization efforts of public firms, and demand for innovation by public firms accelerates entrepreneurial activity in private equity markets.

Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to recover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. Therefore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant–product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework.

Using a longitudinal and comprehensive database on the population of U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, we find no evidence of an S‐shaped relationship; nor do we see a moderating effect of intangible assets. Although our results do show a marginally significant U‐shaped association between multinationality and performance for a subsample of manufacturing firms, this relationship disappears once we account for the endogeneity of multinationality. Our study contributes to empirical research on the multinationality‐performance relationship, highlighting the need for caution in generalizing results across countries and the importance of controlling for the endogeneity of multinationality when assessing its effect on performance. Managerial summary: Our study examines the relationship between a firm's multinationality and its performance. In a much‐cited study, Lu and Beamish (2004) found evidence of an S‐shaped relationship—with firm performance first decreasing, then increasing, then decreasing again as firms internationalized—in a sample of Japanese firms from 1986 to 1997. We test for the same relationship across all U.S. MNCs from 1989 to 2007, and find no evidence of an S‐shaped pattern, or indeed, of any effect of multinationality at an aggregate level. Our study thus suggests that the effect of multinationality may vary with firm capabilities and home country environments, and that managers and academics alike should focus on understanding these specifics, rather than searching for a universal effect of multinationality on performance .

Few researches investigate whether exporters can enhance export performance after M&A through higher levels of efficiency. Based on detailed information on M&A activities of Chinese firms, China's customs trade data and National Bureau of Statistics surveys, we investigate the causal effect of M&A on trade performance. In particular, the value and the volume of firm exports, product quality, product scope and the number of export destinations have been examined. We find positive and significant effects of M&A on all the examined indicators of export performance. These findings are generally robust to a variety of robustness checks. We further observe that state-owned firms are the least likely to benefit from M&A. We also obtain evidence that firms benefit more from M&A deals if they are targets or merge with foreign firms.

Although it is known that self-employed workers have tax compliance and reporting issues, the existing reporting rules applicable to most workers earning income in the on-demand economy substantially increase the likelihood that these taxpayers are failing to contribute to Social Security and Medicare through payment of the self-employment tax (SE tax). As such, this paper sheds light on the Social Security implications of current federal tax rules for independent contractors generally and, in particular, workers earning income through occupations occurring in the on-demand economy by estimating the population and earnings of these workers using the U.S. Census Bureau’s redesigned Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).By analyzing 2014 SIPP data, we identify a population of self-employed, non-employer respondents working outside of a traditional employment relationship (“independent contractors”), as well as individuals working in occupations in the on-demand economy (“on-demand workers”). SIPP data have the potential to capture workers who earn income using on-demand platforms to connect with customers and process payments (“on-platform work”), as well as workers who earn income in occupations occurring in the on-demand economy who do not use on-demand platforms (“off-platform work”).Additionally, with SIPP data, we are able to estimate the income that independent contractors and on-demand workers earned in these employment relationships in 2014. Using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on the tax gap, U.S. Treasury Department audit data on underpayment of the SE tax, and survey data on tax compliance by on-demand economy workers and the self-employed, we are able to create an estimate of how much SE tax should have been paid on this income but likely was not. To provide context for our findings, we applied the methodology we developed to estimate the likely underpayment of the SE tax to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the number of independent contractors and on-platform workers in 2017. In addition, using SIPP, we were able to provide supplemental demographic data on independent contractors and the on-demand platform workforce.",2019,2019-01-01,43,C. Bruckner; Thomas L.

It has long been hypothesized that management is an important component of firm success, but until recently the study of management was confined to hypotheses, anecdotes, and case studies. Building upon the work of Bloom and Van Reenen (2007), the first-ever large scale survey of management practices in the United States, the MOPS, was conducted by the Census Bureau for 2010. A second, enhanced version of the MOPS is being conducted for 2015. The enhancement includes two new topics related to management: data and decision making (DDD) and uncertainty. As information technology has expanded plants are increasingly able to utilize data in their decision making. Structured management practices have been found to be complementary to DDD in earlier studies. Uncertainty has policy implications because uncertainty is found to be associated with reduced investment and employment.

With decreasing response rates and increasing interest for more timely and geographically detailed estimates, imputation methodology that combines multiple data sources to adjust for low unit response and allow for more detailed publication levels, including geographic estimates, is both timely and necessary. Motivated by the Advance Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MARTS) and Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS), we propose Bayesian hierarchical multiple imputation-dependent data models with the goals of automating imputation for the MARTS by using historic MRTS data and providing geographically granular (state-level) estimates for the MRTS via mass imputation using third-party data and spatial dependence. As a natural byproduct of this approach, measures of uncertainty are provided. This article illustrates the advantages of applying established Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques with multiple source data to address practical problems in official statistics and is, therefore, of independent interest. The motivating empirical studies are unified by their hierarchical modeling framework, which ultimately results in a more principled approach for estimation for the MARTS and a more geographically granular data product for the MRTS.",2024,2024-04-17,0,Stephen J.

As most people live in households with other persons, this study explores disability at the household level. Considering the literature on household decision-making, solidarity, and capabilities in disability, this analysis of the household context of disability takes into account residential settings, household composition, and urban–rural differences. Method The 2015–2019 ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), which shows persons with disability (PwD) and persons without disability (PwoD), also indicates household membership, used here to separately identify PwoD as those living in households with persons with disability (PwoD_HHwD) and those in households without any household member with disability (PwoD_HHwoD). Relationship variables reveal the composition of households with and without disabilities. An adaption of Beale's rural–urban continuum code for counties is used to approximate rural–urban differences with ACS PUMS data. Results Solo living is two times as common among persons with disability than among persons without disability, and higher in rural than urban areas. In addition to 43 million PwD, there are another 42 million PwoD_HHwD. Two times as many persons are impacted by disability, either of their own or that of a household member, than shown by an analysis of individual-level disability. For family households, differences in the composition of households with and without disabilities are considerable with much greater complexities in the makeup of families with disability. The presence of multiple generations stands out. Adult sons or daughters without disability play an important role. Modest urban–rural differences exist in the composition of family households with disability, with a greater presence of multigenerational households in large cities. Discussion This research reveals the much wider scope of household-level disability than indicated by disability of individuals alone. The greater complexity and multigenerational makeup of households with disability imply intergenerational solidarity, reciprocity, and resource sharing. Household members without disability may add to the capabilities of persons with disabilities.

To understand the connection between automation and total factor productivity, we estimate a CES model of production where a plant chooses the degree of automation by adjusting the relative weight of capital and production labor given their relative price. The results indicate that, in the presence of heterogeneity in the extent of automation, productivity estimates are more dispersed and skewed relative to Cobb-Douglas residuals, and that the choice of functional form affects the level of productivity estimates. Overall, broad and deep automation is concentrated in larger plants with higher total factor productivity and lower labor share, consistent with a role for automation in contributing to dispersion in input utilization and market share.",2023,2023-07-10,59,Emin Dinlersoz; Zoltán Wolf,United States Census Bureau; United States Census Bureau; New Light Industries (United States),Firm Innovation and Growth; Economic Growth and Productivity; Global trade and economics,Economics of Innovation and New Technology,07,"Dinlersoz, Emin; Wolf, Zoltán. 2023.

We show that investment is weak relative to measures of profitability and valuation—particularly Tobin's Q—and that this weakness starts in the early 2000s. There are two broad categories of explanations: theories that predict low investment along with a low Q, and theories that predict low investment despite a high Q. We argue that the data do not support the first category, so we focus on the second one. We use industry-level and firm-level data to test whether underinvestment relative to Q is driven by (i) financial frictions; (ii) changes in the nature or localization of investment, due to the rise of intangibles, globalization, and the like; (iii) decreased competition, due to technology, regulation, or common ownership; or (iv) tightened corporate governance or increased short-termism. We do not find support for theories based on financial frictions. We find some support for globalization and regulation; and we find strong support for the intangibles, competition, and short-termism or corporate governance hypotheses. We estimate that the rise of intangibles explains about one-third of the drop in investment, while concentration and corporate governance explain the rest. Industries with more concentration and more common ownership invest less, even after controlling for current market conditions and intangibles. Within each industry-year, the investment gap is driven by firms owned by quasi-indexers and located in industries with more concentration and common ownership. These firms return a disproportionate amount of free cash flows to shareholders. Finally, we show that slow-moving changes in competition are difficult to detect in macroeconomic series; standard growth-accounting decompositions confound market power and other medium-run trends, such as falling total factor productivity and labor participation.",2017,2017-01-01,167,Germán Gutiérrez; Thomas Philippon,New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,Corporate Finance and Governance; Economic theories and models; Economic Growth and Productivity,Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,01,"Gutiérrez, Germán; Philippon, Thomas. 2017.

The explanations proposed for the decline in the employment-to-population ratio have been of two broad types. One set of explanations emphasizes cyclical factors associated with the recession; the second set of explanations focuses on the role of longer-run structural factors. In this paper, we argue that while the decline in manufacturing and the consequent reduction in demand for less-educated workers put downward pressure on their employment rates in the pre-recession 2000–2006 period, the increased demand for less-educated workers because of the housing boom was simultaneously pushing their employment rates upwards. For a few years, the housing boom served to “mask” the labor market effects of manufacturing decline for less-educated workers. When the housing market collapsed in 2007, there was a large, immediate decline in employment among these workers, who faced not only the sudden disappearance of jobs related to the housing boom, but also the fact that manufacturing's steady decline during the early 2000s left them with many fewer opportunities in that sector than had existed at the start of the decade.",2016,2016-05-01,108,Kerwin Kofi Charles; Erik Hurst; Matthew Notowidigdo,University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Housing, Finance, and Neoliberalism; Migration, Aging, and Tourism Studies; Retirement, Disability, and Employment",The Journal of Economic Perspectives,05,"Charles, Kerwin Kofi; Hurst, Erik; Notowidigdo, Matthew. 2016.

The analysis uses restricted-access U.S. Census Bureau data aggregated to the county level, along with secondary data sources, to estimate the locational determinants of transportation and warehousing (TW) industries based on transportation infrastructure as well as sociodemographic and institutional variables.

The study uses archival data collected from the Government of Chile to compile and categorize public expenditures and programs supporting the Chilean wine industry over the period of 1990–2012 into investment in different types of knowledge capital. These spending categories are related to industry-level sales growth. The paper finds that the most important correlate is spending on research and development. The study also uses data from a new survey of Chilean wine firms to capture information on firm-specific investments in knowledge capital. The findings show that investments in collaboration capital, in particular hiring foreign consultants, as well as participation in international wine fairs are the strongest correlates of growth in export sales, while spending on aspects of branding (local advertising and brand design) are the strongest correlates of domestic market sales growth.

In this article, we examine these worrying labor market trends, focusing on outcomes for males without a college education. Though wages and participation have fallen in tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neoclassical framework, which postulates a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain the data. Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives. In the synthesis that emerges, the phenomenon of declining prime-age male labor-force participation is not coherently explained by a series of causal factors acting separately. A more reasonable interpretation, we argue, involves complex feedbacks between labor demand, family structure, and other factors that have disproportionately affected less-educated men.",2019,2019-05-01,75,Ariel Binder; John Bound,University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan,"Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality; Retirement, Disability, and Employment",The Journal of Economic Perspectives,05,"Binder, Ariel; Bound, John. 2019.

In this paper, we investigate whether the oral contraceptive pill played a causal role in the rise of nonmarital births. Exploiting exogenous variation in laws governing access to the pill, we find that changes in marital access to the pill increased the nonmarital birthrate by between 15% and 18%, accounting for about one‐third of the overall increase in nonmarital births. These effects are concentrated almost entirely among women whose fathers did not graduate high school and among minority women. We also document that the pill increased spacing between first and second births, and lowered the probability that a woman obtained a high‐school diploma, consistent with increases in nonmarital births. We find no evidence that postsecondary education levels were influenced by pill access, and no evidence that nonmarital births move with male employment patterns. Our findings add to a growing literature which documents the power of the pill to shape women's lives in broadly heterogenous ways, with minority and less‐well‐educated women bearing the brunt of the losses, a phenomenon we call the paradox of the pill.

The administrative trade data underlying the unit values have greatly improved since that time. The transaction records are now more detailed, available electronically, and compiled monthly with little delay. The data are used by academic researchers to calculate price measures, and unit value indexes based on trade data are used by other national statistical offices (NSOs). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is now evaluating whether replacing price indexes with unit value indexes for homogeneous products calculated from administrative trade data could expand the number of published official import and export price indexes. Using export transactions, the research calculates detailed unit value indexes from 200 + million trade records from 2012–2017 for 123 export product categories. Results show that 27 of the 123 unit value indexes are homogeneous and closely comparable to published official price indexes. This article presents the concepts and methods considered to calculate and evaluate the unit value indexes and to select the product categories that are homogeneous. Compared to official price indexes, export unit value indexes for the 27 5-digit BEA (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) end-use product categories would deflate real exports of these goods by 13 percentage points less over the period.

We revisit the inherent market failures in health care markets that necessitate key ACA exchange regulations and investigate whether they have succeeded in their goals of expanding coverage, creating robust marketplaces, providing product variety, and generating innovation in health care delivery. We discuss empirical IO research to date and also highlight shortcomings in the existing research that can be addressed moving forward.

Three proximate factors account for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours. The greater career discontinuity and shorter work hours for female MBAs are largely associated with motherhood.

The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.

Bacteria also conduct a census of their population and do so more frequently, more efficiently, and as far we know, with little if any of the political contentiousness caused by human demographers. Many examples have been found of particular bacterial genes, operons, or regulons that are expressed preferentially at high cell densities. Many of these are regulated by proteins related to the LuxR and LuxI proteins of Vibrio fischeri, and by a diffusible pheromone called an autoinducer. LuxR and LuxI and their cognate autoinducer (3-oxohexanoyl homoserine lactone, designated VAI-1) provide an important model to describe the functions of this family of proteins. LuxR is a VAI-1 receptor and a VAI-1–dependent transcriptional activator, and LuxI directs the synthesis of VAI-1. VAI-1 diffuses across the bacterial envelope, and intracellular concentrations of it are therefore strongly increased by nearby VAI-1–producing bacteria. Similar systems regulate pathogenesis factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Erwinia spp., as well as Ti plasmid conjugal transfer in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and many other genes in numerous genera of gram-negative bacteria. Genetic analyses of these systems have revealed a high degree of functional conservation, while also uncovering features that are unique to each.",1996,1996-10-01,1205,Clay Fuqua; Stephen C.

Yet because of differences in national origin, physical appearance, historical memory, class, and religion, no single group identity exists for this rapidly growing population. In part because of this diversity, in the 2000 Census, respondents, for the first time, could select more than one racial category. Clara Rodríguez’s newest work on Latinos in the U.S. examines difficulties in categorizing this group as part of a broader discussion of ethnicity and race in the United States. She chose as her lens the U.S. Census Bureau because census categories and definitions reveal a society’s “dominant ideals and beliefs” (p. xiv) and such definitions shape how peoples and individuals see themselves and others. Rodríguez’s aim is to demonstrate through the Latino experience that race is not fixed; it is “imperfectly measured” and can lead to discrimination and misunderstanding. A sociologist by training, Rodríguez draws upon her own experiences as a Latina, on interviews, analyses of census data, and secondary works from a variety of disciplines.The difficulty in classifying Latinos underscores one of Rodríguez’s main points: definitions of race and ethnicity are subjective and dependent on context. Some public agencies consider Latinos a race, but the Bureau of the Census does not (a topic to which the author devotes ample space). Rodríguez argues that most in the U.S. conflate race and ethnicity, and see race as genetically determined and fixed (as evidenced by Census Bureau efforts to make Latinos and other groups fit the bipolar racial categories of white and non-white). Meanwhile, for Latinos, race and ethnicity are culturally determined, fluid, and contextual. As Rodríguez explains, these divergent notions of race and ethnicity came out of our respective historical experiences.Rodríguez describes the evolution of the U.S.’s bipolar racial paradigm by tracing the Census Bureau’s two-hundred-year history of shifting categories and criteria. She ably links changing racial definitions over time to broader social and political factors, and sees the Bureau’s recent efforts to more accurately categorize Hispanics as evidence that notions of race and ethnicity are undergoing further adjustment in this country.This broad treatment of Latino identity and U.S. efforts to categorize its diverse populations will complement the plethora of new works on the Latino experience in the U.S. It should prove useful also to historians of race and ethnicity in America. While Rodríguez’s arguments are somewhat disorganized and repetitive, the redundancy permits the use of individual chapters for teaching purposes. Further, although little new scholarship appears here, the author provides a relatively thorough review of the literature on issues such as Latino identity formation and acculturation. In addition, Rodríguez’s history of Census activities is also quite thorough, and the book is richly documented. Those seeking more on the historical development of notions of race and ethnicity in Latin America will no doubt be disappointed, however, given the outdated and limited resources consulted. Perhaps the real value of this work is the perspective it offers on how Latinos in this country have been perceived and how they perceive themselves. It is likely that this population group will prove quite instrumental in reshaping our ideas of race and ethnicity.",2001,2001-08-01,294,Elaine C.

The analysis uses a sociology of knowledge perspective which assumes that race is an ideological concept that can be interpreted most productively by relating its definition and measurement to the larger social and political context. Four themes are identified and discussed: (i) the historical and continuing importance of skin colour, usually dichotomized into white and non‐white, in defining race and counting racial groups; (ii) a belief in 'pure' races that is reflected in a preoccupation with categorizing people into a single or 'pure' race; (iii) the role of census categories in creating pan‐ethnic racial groups; and, (iv) the confusing of race and ethnicity in census racial classifications. Each theme demonstrates the potential or actual role of official statistics, exemplified by census racial data, in reflecting and guiding changes to the meaning and social perceptions of race. A detailed examination of racial classifications from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses shows that the influence of political interests on racial statistics is particularly important. The article concludes with a discussion of whether official statistical recorders such as population censuses should categorize and measure race, given the political motivations and non‐scientific character of the classifications used.",1993,1993-01-01,249,Sharon M.

A global night-time image product was registered to a dataset of 2000 known city locations with known populations. A relationship between areal extent and city population discovered by Tobler and Nordbeck is identified on a nation by nation basis to estimate the population of the 22 920 urban clusters that exist in the night-time satellite image. The relationship between city population and city areal extent was derived from 1597 city point locations with known population that landed in a 'lit' area of the image. Due to conurbation, these 1597 cities resulted in only 1383 points of analysis for performing regression. When several cities fell into one 'lit' area their populations were summed. The results of this analysis allow for an estimate of the urban population of every nation of the world. By using the known percent of population in urban areas for every nation a total national population was also estimated. The sum of these estimates is a total estimate of the global human population, which in this case was 6.3 billion.

The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.,2001,2001-11-01,164,Richard Williams; Margo Anderson; Stephen E.

These techniques are demonstrated with 1980-2000 census data from the 13-county Atlanta metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover data derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery were used to determine the areal extent of populated areas, which in turn served as the denominator for dasymetric population density computations at the census tract level. The dasymetric method accounts for the spatial distribution of population within administrative areas, yielding more precise population density estimates than the choroplethic method, while graphically representing the geographic distribution of populations. In order to areally interpolate census data from one set of census tract boundaries to another, the percentages of populated areas affected by boundary changes in each affected tract were used as adjustment weights for census data at the census tract level, where census tract boundary shifts made temporal data comparisons difficult. This method of areal interpolation made it possible to represent three years of census data (1980, 1990, and 2000) in one set of common census tracts (1990). Accuracy assessment of the dasymetrically derived adjustment weights indicated a satisfactory level of accuracy. Dasymetrically derived areal interpolation weights can be applied to any type of geographic boundary re-aggregation, such as from census tracts to zip code tabulation areas, from census tracts to local school districts, from zip code areas to telephone exchange prefix areas, and for electoral redistricting.",2004,2004-01-01,199,James B.

Evidence from School-based Health Centers,Cornell,2019.0,2023.0,Michael Lovenheim,Zip Code Caveat: Bias Due to Spatiotemporal Mismatches Between Zip Codes and US Census–Defined Geographic Areas—The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project,article,published,2002.0,92,7,1100-1102,https://doi.org/10.2105/ajph.92.7.1100,Zip Code Caveat: Bias Due to Spatiotemporal Mismatches Between Zip Codes and US Census–Defined Geographic Areas—The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project,"Use of zip codes in US public health research is on the rise. As of February 2002, 230 articles were indexed by zip code in PubMed,1 all published since 1989. Fifty-two of these articles (23%) involved the use of censusderived zip code socioeconomic data (e.g., median household income) to investigate the effects of socioeconomic position on specified health outcomes (article citations are available on request from the authors).

To date, discussions regarding the use of zip code socioeconomic data for US public health research have focused chiefly on whether zip codes' larger population size (average: 30 000) and potentially greater socioeconomic heterogeneity would attenuate estimates of socioeconomic gradients in health detected using zip codes in comparison with estimates obtained via census tract (average population: 4000) or block group (average population: 1000) socioeconomic data.2–7 Unacknowledged in the public health literature, however, is the fact that zip codes differ from census tracts and block groups in other important ways, including spatiotemporal definition and stability.

Unlike census tracts, defined by the US Bureau of the Census as “small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision[s] of a county . . . designed to be relatively homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions,”8(ppG-10–G-11) zip codes are “administrative units established by the United States Postal Service . . . for the most efficient delivery of mail, and therefore generally do not respect political or census statistical area boundaries.”9(pA-13) Spanning in size from a single building or company with a high volume of mail to large areas that cut across states, “carrier routes for one zip code may intertwine with those of one or more zip codes” such that “this area is more conceptual than geographic.”10

To “overcome the difficulties in precisely defining the land area covered by each zip code,”11 the US Census Bureau created a new statistical entity built from census blocks: the 5-digit zip code tabulation area (ZCTA), first used in the 2000 census.12 Of note, ZCTAs and zip codes sharing the same 5-digit code may not necessarily cover the same area (Table 1 ▶),13 so that zip codes obtained via self-report or from addresses in medical records cannot be assumed to correspond to census-defined ZCTAs.



TABLE 1

—Technical Definitions of and Distinctions Between Zip Codes and Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)



Even before introduction of the ZCTAs, there were 2 types of spatiotemporal discontinuity that could conceivably affect health studies linking zip codes to census-derived data: (1) changes in zip code delivery routes—and hence in population covered by the affected zip code—and (2) discontinuation and addition of zip codes in nondecennial years.14–16 Between 1997 and 2001 alone, the US Post Office added approximately 390 new zip codes nationwide and discontinued 120 (oral communication, Meg Ausman, US Post Office Data Center, February 5, 2002). One implication of these changes is that persons could be correctly geocoded to a zip code that did not exist in the preceding decennial census.

Findings from the Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project17 illustrate the potential problems for health research of spatiotemporal zip code–census mismatches, even those dating from before the creation of ZCTAs. This project was designed to assess which area-based socioeconomic measures at which levels of geography (census tract, block group, and zip code) are most appropriate for monitoring socioeconomic inequalities in health. Health data from 2 states (Massachusetts and Rhode Island) and the 1990 census were used. Records were geocoded in 1999 by a firm whose accuracy we ascertained to be high (96%),18 and the firm, following standard practice, returned the most recent geocodes available.

Cancer incidence rates were one of the health outcomes addressed. We found that in Massachusetts (474 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), 17 376 (10.4%) of the 166 730 cancer cases occurring during 1987 to 1993 were geocoded to 193 zip codes not included in the 1990 census; 15 774 (90.8%) of these 17 376 cases were in one of 30 zip codes changed or established after the 1990 census.19–21 By contrast, in Rhode Island (70 zip codes listed in the 1990 census), only 0.7% (148) of the 19 766 geocoded cancer incidence records were matched to zip codes not included in the 1990 census.

In the case of colon cancer incidence in Massachusetts, moreover, the impact of excluding persons linked to zip codes not included in the 1990 census was substantial. Zip code–level analyses yielded socioeconomic gradients contrary to those observed via data at the tract and block group levels and contrary to those reported in the literature (Tables 2–4 ▶ ▶ ▶).22

Given the growing interest in linking geographic and health data,23,24 we urge researchers, when using geocoded records, to pay careful attention to the potential for spatiotemporal mismatches between censusderived and zip code data as well as to changes in zip code boundaries and years in which boundaries were established. Public health projects and programs that use zip code data should likewise be alert to potential new issues stemming from the replacement of zip codes with ZCTAs in the 2000 census.",2002,2002-07-01,378,Nancy Krieger; Pamela D.

The Importance of Nonreporting and Census Imputation,"In the most frequently used microdata sets, over a quarter of all respondents now refuse to answer some questions about their incomes. The Census Bureau has dealt with this problem, which has been increasing in severity over time, by imputing incomes of non-respondents. Their imputation procedure, called the ""hot deck,"" essentially matches nonrespondents with demographically similar donors. In this paper we evaluate the census imputation methodology and raise some questions. First, the census procedure is tied to commonality of events in the population rather than the more appropriate informational content of regressors. Clearly, the census procedure severely understates income in certain occupations. Because it is based on the apparently invalid assumption that income does not affect reporting propensities, it most likely understates average incomes as well.",1986,1986-06-01,216,Lee A.

Mobility increases and economic restructuring since the 1980s, however, call for new conceptualizations of migration. Using interprovincial migration data from China's 1990 and 2000 censuses, I analyze migration rates, migration effectiveness, population growth, net migration flows, and spatial focusing of migration. The analysis supports the notions that migration is an increasingly effective factor of population redistribution and that it has a strong relationship with regional development. While these relationships have been documented in many other parts of the world, they have been less well addressed in the case of China. Regional divergence in economic development during the 1990s was accompanied by a marked increase in interprovincial migration and sharply concentrated migration flows, especially from relatively poor central and western provinces to the rapidly growing eastern region. These results suggest that migration theories that draw from experiences of capitalist economies may be of increased relevance to China.",2005,2005-05-01,233,C.

The PES was a stratified block sample with heavy emphasis placed on hard-to-count population groups. Matching the individuals in the census to the individuals in the PES is an important aspect of census coverage evaluation and consequently a very important process for any census adjustment operations that might be planned. For such an adjustment to be feasible, record-linkage software had to be developed that could perform matches with a high degree of accuracy and that was based on an underlying mathematical theory. A principal purpose of the PES was to provide an opportunity to evaluate the newly implemented record-linkage system and associated methodology. This article discusses the theoretical and practical issues encountered in conducting the matching operation and presents the results of that operation. A review of the theoretical background of the record-linkage problem provides a framework for discussions of the decision procedure, file blocking, and the independence assumption. The estimation of the parameters required by the decision procedure is an important aspect of the methodology, and the techniques presented provide a practical system that is easily implemented. The matching algorithm (discussed in detail) uses the linear sum assignment model to ""pair"" the records. The Tampa, Florida, matching methodology is described in the final sections of the article. Included in the discussion are the results of the matching itself, an independent clerical review of the matches and nonmatches, conclusions, problem areas, and future work required.",1989,1989-06-01,175,Matthew A.

The impact of the US Supreme Court hearing and decision in Wisconsin vs New York is discussed followed by an analysis of the Census Bureaus plans for the Census in 2000. Census procedures have been challenged since 1988. Litigation forced the use of the Post Enumeration Survey for adjusting the 1990 Census but the Census Director in 1991 issued a recommendation for not adjusting the 1990 counts that was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1993. Oral arguments were heard in the aforementioned New York case on January 10 1996. New York argued for the implementation of dual system estimation due to undercounting errors that were probably influenced by actions of Republican Commerce officials during the 1980s that prevented improvements in census counting. It was charged that Census Bureau methods violated the intent of Article 1 Section 2 of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. Lawsuits challenged the Bureau to develop methods that would reduce the undercount of minorities and the urban poor. Other arguments of the state of Oklahoma Wisconsin the federal government for the Secretary of Commerce and New York City are summarized. The Solicitor General of the US Drew Days argued that the true total population of the US was unknown and unknowable and that the Secretary of Commerce had the authority to make decisions about the census. The main issue before the court became who had the authority to decide not to adjust. All of the US Supreme Court judges voted on March 20 1996 in favor of unadjusted census counts. The issue of statistical adjustment methods as a violation of the Constitution was not decided. Plans for the census of 2000 include reducing costs and increasing accuracy through a three-stage count strategy.,2000,2000-04-01,108,,,Census and Population Estimation,Choice Reviews Online,04,"Unknown Author. 2000.

Our results indicate that the racial identification of biracial children with an Asian parent is to a large extent an arbitrary option within today's prevailing racial classification scheme.

Our approach requires an additional recapture.

The very same day, a group of leading ethnographers met at the Academy of Sciences in Petrograd to discuss a directive they had received from the Soviet of Nationalities: define nationality, determine “rational criteria” for classifying the population in the first All-Union Census, and notify the Central Statistical Administration as soon as possible. The legal formation of the Soviet Union had been completed, but the state-building process, which involved “re-imagining” the former Russian empire as a socialist federation of nationalities, was just getting under way. This essay argues that the classification of Soviet citizens by nationality in the All-Union Censuses of 1926, 1937, and 1939 was a fundamental component of the creation of the multinational state. The very establishment of the census category nationality marked a critical break with the tsarist regime, which had categorized its subjects on the basis of religion and native language. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists from Minsk to Vladivostok who formulated questionnaires and drew up lists of nationalities for all three censuses used their expertise to divine order out of chaos and create a new definitional grid. Not only did they have to decide which tribes, clans, and peoples belonged to which nationality, they also had to figure out what “nationality” meant.",1997,1997-01-01,170,Francine Hirsch,Princeton University,Soviet and Russian History; Eastern European Communism and Reforms; European history and politics,Slavic Review,01,"Hirsch, Francine. 1997.

Until recently, such categorization had largely escaped critical scrutiny, being viewed and treated as a technical procedure requiring little conceptual clarity or historical explanation. Recent political developments and methodological changes, in US censuses especially, have engendered a critical reexamination of both the comparative and the historical dimensions of categorization. The author presents a comparative analysis of the histories of racial/color categorization in American and Brazilian censuses and shows that racial (and color) categories have appeared in these censuses because of shifting ideas about race and the enduring power of these ideas as organizers of political, economic, and social life in both countries. These categories have not appeared simply as demographic markers.

In many countries this is usually accomplished using address range TIGER-type files in conjunction with geocoding packages within a GIS. Improvements in GIS functionality and the storage capacity of large databases mean that the spatial investigation of data at the individual address level is now commonly performed. This process relies on the accuracy of the geocoding mechanism and this paper examines this accuracy in relation to cadastral records and census tracts. Results from a study of over 20 000 addresses in Sydney, Australia, using a TIGER-type geocoding process suggest that 5-7.5% (depending on geocoding method) of addresses may be misallocated to census tracts, and more than 50% may be given coordinates within the land parcel of a different property.",2001,2001-07-01,158,Jerry H.

Several analysts are exploring the effects of early-life socioeconomic conditions, environmental exposures, or natural disasters on family, health, and economic outcomes in later life. Other studies exploit natural experiments to gauge the impact of policy interventions such as social welfare programs and educational reforms.

This project represents the most extensive application of multiple imputation to date, and the modeling effort was considerable as well—hundreds of logistic regressions were estimated. One goal of this article is to summarize the strategies used in the project so that researchers can better understand how the new data bases were created. Another goal is to show how modifications of maximum likelihood methods were made for the modeling and imputation phases of the project. To multiply-impute 1980 census-comparable codes for industries and occupations in two 1970 census public-use samples, logistic regression models were estimated with flattening constants. For many of the regression models considered, the data were too sparse to support conventional maximum likelihood analysis, so some alternative had to be employed. These methods solve existence and related computational problems often encountered with maximum likelihood methods. Inferences pertaining to effects of predictor variables and inferences regarding predictions from logit models are also more satisfactory. The Bayesian strategy used in this project can be applied in other sparse-data settings where logistic regression is used because the approach can be implemented easily with any standard computer program for logit regression or log-linear analysis.",1991,1991-03-01,186,Clifford C.

The most recent of these, issued 13 January 2000, for the first time extend to the year 2100 and also include information on the foreign‐bom population. (Earlier projections were carried up to 2080.) The extensive tabulations presenting the new set, and detailed explanation of the methodology and the assumptions underlying the projections, are accessible at the Census Bureau's web site: http://www.census.gov . A brief summary of some of the main results of these projections is reproduced below from United States Department of Commerce News , Washington, DC 20230. (The Census Bureau is an agency of the Department of Commerce.) Uncertainties as to future trends in fertility, mortality, and net migration over a period of some 100 years are very great, as is illustrated by the massive difference in the projected size of the population for 2100 in the three variants produced. The “middle” projected population figure of 571 million (which represents a growth of some 109 percent over its current level) is bracketed by “lowest” and “highest” alternative projections of 283 million and 1.18 billion, respectively. With somewhat lesser force, the point also applies to the 50‐year time span considered in the well‐known country‐by‐country projections of the United Nations. These projections are also detailed in three variants: low, middle, and high. The UN projections (last revised in 1998) envisage less rapid growth in the United States during the first part of the twenty‐first century than do the Census Bureau's. The projected population figures for 2050 in the three variants (low, middle, and high) are as follows (in millions): U.S. Census Bureau 313.5 403.7 552.8 United Nations 292.8 349.3 419.0 Since the initial age and sex distributions from which the two sets of population projections start are essentially identical, these differences reflect assumptions by the Census Bureau with respect to the three factors affecting population dynamics in the next 50 years. In the middle series, each of these assumptions is more growth‐producing in the Census Bureau's set than in that of the United Nations. Thus, in the middle of the twenty‐first century the Census Bureau anticipates male and female life expectancies of 81.2 and 86.7 years; the corresponding figures according to the UN are 78.8 and 84.4 years. Net immigration to the United States per 1000 population at midcentury is assumed to be 2.2 by the United Nations and somewhat above 2.4 according to the Census Bureau. The factor most affecting the difference between the projected population sizes, however, is the differing assumptions with respect to fertility. The middle UN series anticipates a midcentury US total fertility rate of 1.9 children per woman; the Census Bureau's assumption is slightly above 2.2. A notable feature of the Census Bureau's projection methodology in comparison to that of the UN is the recognition of differences in mortality and fertility, and also in immigration, with respect to race and Hispanic origin. Thus, at midcentury the white non‐Hispanic population is assumed to have a total fertility rate of 2.03; the corresponding figure for the population of Hispanic origin is 2.56. (Fertility in other population subgroups is expected to lie between these values, although closer to the fertility of non‐Hispanic whites.) And Hispanic immigration, currently the major component within total immigration, is assumed to remain significant throughout the next five decades (although by midcentury it is expected to be far exceeded by immigration of non‐Hispanic Asians). As a result, the structure of the US population by race and Hispanic origin is expected to shift markedly. To the extent that fertility and mortality differentials persist, such a shift also affects the mean fertility and mortality figures of the total population.",2000,2000-03-01,9,,,Economic Growth and Productivity,Population and Development Review,03,"Unknown Author. 2000.

Overall, the patterns across the four models were mostly consistent with the effects hypothesized based on the study's crime pattern theory and time‐geography theoretical frame; yet differences in the magnitudes of the coefficients were less pronounced than hypothesized.

In the past, it has relied on alternative scenarios, low, medium, and high, to reflect varying interpretations of current trends in fertility, mortality, and international migration to forecast population. This approach has limitations that have been noted in the recent literature on population forecasting. Census Bureau researchers are embarking on an attempt to incorporate probabilistic reasoning to forecast prediction intervals around point forecasts to future dates. The current literature offers a choice of approaches to this problem. We are opting to employ formal time series modeling of parameters of fertility, mortality, and international migration, with stochastic renewal processes. The endeavor is complicated by the administrative necessity to produce a large amount of racial and Hispanic origin detail in the population, as well as the ubiquitous cross‐categories of age and sex. As official population forecasts must meet user demand, we are faced with the added challenge of presenting and supporting the resulting product in a way that is comprehensible to users, many of whom have little or no comprehension of the technical forecasting literature, and are accustomed to simple, deterministic answers. We may well find a need to modify our strategy, depending on the realities that may emerge from the limitations of data, the administrative requirements of the product, and the diverse needs of our user community.",2004,2004-08-01,7,John F.

Socially and politically recognized boundaries between groups shifted, new groups emerged, others disappeared, and notions of who belonged in which category changed. All recognized racial groups—blacks, whites, Indians, Asians, Mexicans and others—were affected. This article investigates how and why census racial classification policies changed during this period, only to stabilize abruptly before World War II. In the context of demographic transformations and their political consequences, we find that census policy in any given year was driven by a combination of scientific, political, and ideological motivations. Based on this analysis, we rethink existing theoretical approaches to censuses and racial classification, arguing that a nation's census is deeply implicated in and helps to construct its social and political order. Censuses provide the concepts, taxonomy, and substantive information by which a nation understands its component parts as well as the contours of the whole; censuses both create the image and provide the mirror of that image for a nation's self-reflection.

These studies are limited, however, by their exclusive focus on men, which ignores important gender differences in the wage gap, and by the inadequacy of the mean wage for characterizing the gap when, as in recent decades, the wage distribution dramatically changes. This study of recent immigrants examines changes across the entire wage distribution, for both genders. The authors find evidence, based partly on gender differences, that minimum wages strongly influenced the gap. A counterfactual analysis also indicates that if recent immigrants in 1970 had faced the 1990 wage structure, their wage distribution would have closely resembled that of recent immigrants in 1990.

This article presents these controversies from an administrative perspective, with emphasis on accountability and accountability conflicts. As an administrative agency with its mission to produce accurate and credible statistics—free from political manipulation—the Census Bureau is accountable to its hierarchical authority in the Department of Commerce, Congress, the statistical community, and the courts. Conflicts often take place among these accountability dimensions, breeding controversies in census operations, hindering the bureau's efficiency, and threatening the credibility of census statistics.

For these purposes, projections are often needed for small areas such as census tracts, zip code areas or traffic analysis zones. Population size, growth constraints, shifting boundaries, and data availability create special problems for small-area projections, however, and very little is known about their forecasting performance. In this article we evaluate the accuracy and bias of projections of total population and population by age group for census tracts in three counties in Florida. We use data from 1970 and 1980 and several simple extrapolation techniques to produce projections for 1990; we then compare these projections with 1990 census counts and evaluate the differences. For the total sample, we find mean absolute errors of 17%-20% for the three most accurate techniques for projecting total population and find no indication of overall bias. For individual age groups, mean absolute errors range from 20%-29%. We believe that this analysis provides valuable information for demographers, planners, marketers, and others who make extensive use of small-area projections.",1995,1995-03-01,81,Stanley K.

The magnitude of Type I error for each test was estimated from simulated density—independent data having the same mean and variance as the observed censuses. The actual census data were used to evaluate the ability to detect density dependence. Only autoregression had the desired level of type I error, but this test was ineffective when populations grew or declined. The standard major axis was effective in the latter cases but was ineffective when populations did not grow or decline. The only effective test applicable to all cases was a regression test with a rejection region based oin simulated data. Results of these latter analyses agree with earlier descriptions of interspecific variation in life—history tactics among duck species and the importance of competition as a factor affecting guild structure in prairie—nesting ducks. Diving ducks, which occupy the most temporally stable wetlands, show a greater degree of density dependence than do dabbling ducks, and competition influences the guild structure of diving ducks more than that of dabbling ducks.",1984,1984-02-01,102,William L.

Therefore, the quality of such information is paramount but is not as simple as the crude accuracy of population totals. Furthermore, changes in the pace and nature of modern life, such as the growing geographical mobility of the population, increasingly pose challenges to census practice and data quality. More recently, even the need for a census has been questioned on grounds of financial austerity and widespread availability of alternative population information sources. This article reviews how the modern census originated and how it evolved to confront these challenges, driven by indicators of quality and needs of users, and provides reflections on the future of the census within the national statistical infrastructure. To illustrate our discussions, we use case studies from a diverse range of national contexts.

An assessment of the demographic basis for this change shows that the cohorts from ages 10 to 74 in 1980 increased by substantial amounts, reaching 35 per cent for many ages. Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically impossible—an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels. In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level. States which historically have had large American Indian populations in general had high birth and death rates with reasonable migration rates. Many other states, however, had anomalously low birth and death rates with extraordinarily high implied migration rates. This pattern suggests that the changes in response may have occurred primarily in the latter areas. Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are reported here. The sample figure for American Indians from the 1980 census exceeds the complete count by more than 8 per cent at the national level. Increases occurred in most states, but the amount of increase varied substantially. Also, the increases tend to occur outside American Indian areas (reservations, tribal trust lands, etc.). Such differences are, for the most part, outside of expected sample variability. Furthermore, differences in the number of persons reporting American Indian race and American Indian ancestry were substantial. Some of the causes of these differences are investigated here. The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the quality and utility of these census data for various types of analysis.",1986,1986-09-01,83,Jeffrey S. Passel; Patricia A.

We compare block-level population totals from a sample of 173 census blocks in California across three sources: (1) the 2020 Census, which has been infused with error to protect respondent confidentiality; (2) the California Neighborhoods Count, the first independent enumeration survey of census blocks; and (3) projections based on the 2010 Census and subsequent American Community Surveys. We find that, on average, total population counts provided by the U.S. Census Bureau at the block level for the 2020 Census are not biased in any consistent direction. However, subpopulation totals defined by age, race, and ethnicity are highly variable. Additionally, we find that inconsistencies across the three sources are amplified in large blocks defined in terms of land area or by total housing units, blocks in suburban areas, and blocks that lack broadband access.",2023,2023-11-27,1,Robert Bozick; Lane F.

In support of our argument we describe a set of activities needed to develop EMAF, each of which is well within the current capabilities of the U.S. Census Bureau and discuss various costs and benefits of each. We also describe how EMAF would provide population estimates containing a wide range of demographic (e.g., age, race, and sex) and socio-economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, income, and employment). As such, it could largely negate and eliminate the need for many of the traditional demographic methods of population estimation and possibly reduce the number of sample surveys. We identify important challenges that must be surmounted in order to realize EMAF and make suggestions for doing so.

IntroductionMortality rates from colorectal cancer have declined over the past decades owing to population-based life-saving screening interventions. However, screening inequalities continue among racial and ethnic minorities despite having a higher disease burden. In this study, we assessed the patterns of up-to-date colorectal cancer screening rates among racial/ethnic groups across the U.S. Census Bureau Divisions.MethodsThis population-based cross-sectional study used weighted data from 4 cycles of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020) of adults aged 50‒75 years without a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The primary outcome was guideline-recommended up-to-date colorectal cancer screening. We used logistic regression models to examine temporal trends in up-to-date colorectal cancer screening from 2014 to 2020. In addition, we conducted detailed descriptive statistics of up-to-date screening rates, comparing trends in 2020 with those in 2014 overall by race/ethnicity and U.S. census divisions.ResultsThe overall proportion of individuals with up-to-date colorectal cancer screening increased from 66.5% in 2014 to 72.5% in 2020 (p<0.001). For racial/ethnic subgroups, from 2014 to 2020, screening rates increased significantly among non-Hispanic Whites (68.5%‒74.5%, p<0.001), non-Hispanic Blacks (68.0%‒74.6%, p<0.001), and Hispanics (51.5%‒62.8%, p<0.001). However, increases were not observed in all U.S. Census Bureau Divisions.ConclusionsAlthough colorectal cancer screening rates improved over time, they fall short of the 80% target.

This paper provides empirical evidence about the link between self-participation rates and census accuracy using data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 U.S Censuses. The preponderance of the evidence shows lower self-participation rates are highly correlated with higher net undercounts and omissions rates for key socio-demographic groups and states. Nine out of 11 correlations examined in this paper are statistically significant and in the predicted direction. One key reason self-participation rates are associated with census accuracy is the fact that the population not captured in the self-participation operation goes into the households for the Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) operation. Census Bureau data show data collected in NRFU is not as accurate as that collected in self-response. The larger the share of data collected for a population that is collected in NFRU, the lower the quality of data for that group. The connection between self-participation rates and census accuracy mean the differential self-participation rates seen in the 2020 Census suggest patterns of net Census undercounts seen in the past are likely to be seen in the 2020 Census.",2020,2020-09-24,1,William P.

We estimate that the 2020 Census will require roughly 90TB of random bytes to protect the person and household tables. Although there are critical differences between cryptography and DP, they have similar requirements for randomness. We review the history of random number generation on deterministic computers, including von Neumann's ""middle-square"" method, Mersenne Twister (MT19937) (previously the default NumPy random number generator, which we conclude is unacceptable for use in production privacy-preserving systems), and the Linux /dev/urandom device.

This study addresses that shortcoming using data from an online survey asking 800 respondents with young children several questions related to children and the census. The results indicate that many respondents have doubts about including young children in the census count for their household. Only 82 percent of low-income parents of young children responded that they would include their young child in the census count for their household. This percentage was lower if children had weaker ties to a household. These survey results provide evidence that misconceptions and confusion about including young children in the census exist and could easily result in young child omissions.

Governance factors are firm‐specific. In spite of this, most empirical studies of foreign direct investment (FDI) have been conducted at the industry level (making it impossible to look at firm‐specific determinants), and only a handful have considered governance, location, and strategic factors simultaneously. This paper is the first large sample study of the determinants of foreign direct investment at the product and firm‐level. It examines the impact of location and governance factors, and of four types of strategic interactions, on a Japanese firm's propensity to manufacture in the U.S. The results support the view that foreign direct investment is explained by location, governance, and strategic variables. Economies of scale and trade barriers encourage Japanese FDI in the U.S. The larger a Japanese firm's R &amp; D expenditures, the greater the probability it will manufacture in the U.S., but this is not the case for advertising expenditures. Some strategic factors are also important: Japanese firms with medium domestic market shares have the highest propensity to invest in the U.S. There is evidence of follow‐the‐leader behavior between firms of rival enterprise groups, but none of ‘exchange‐of‐threat’ between American and Japanese firms.

These areas are generally understood in terms of an immigrant enclave model in which ethnic neighborhoods in central cities serve relatively impoverished new arrivals as a potential base for eventual spatial assimilation with the white majority. This model, and the ethnic community model, are evaluated here. In the ethnic community model, segregated settlement can result from group preferences even when spatial assimilation is otherwise feasible. Analysis of the residential patterns of the largest immigrant groups in New York and Los Angeles shows that most ethnic neighborhoods can be interpreted as immigrant enclaves. In some cases, however living in ethnic neighborhoods is unrelated to economic constraints, indicating a positive preference for such areas. Suburban residence does not necessarily imply living outside of ethnic neighborhoods. Indeed, for several groups the suburban enclave provides an alternative to assimilation-it is an ethnic community in a relatively high-status setting.",2002,2002-04-01,811,John Logan; Wenquan Zhang; Richard Alba,"University at Albany, State University of New York","Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Homelessness and Social Issues; Migration, Ethnicity, and Economy",American Sociological Review,04,"Logan, John; Zhang, Wenquan; Alba, Richard. 2002.

In less than a week, the city's population declined from over 400,000 to near zero.

Will the future New Orleans bear any resemblance to the city that existed prior to Katrina? Most government authorities, from city officials to federal spokespersons, insist that New Orleans must—and should—be fully rebuilt. Many environmental scientists question whether such a rebuilding would be sensible, given the city's precarious geological position and the contribution of past land reclamation to the city's current vulnerability. The more basic positive question of whether the city will come back, however, is fundamentally an economic one.

Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, industrial output is now reported to have increased at a slower rate in 2000 and to have contracted a bit more slowly in 2001 than reported earlier. The changes to total industrial production in other years are slight. The revision still places the most recent peak in total IP in June 2000 and the corresponding trough in December 2001. The 6-1/4 percent peak-to-trough decline in output is about 1/2 percentage point less than the previous estimate. After the trough, the total index showed gains in the first half of 2002, only to trend down again until mid-2003 and then to head up. The revised measures of overall capacity are only minimally different from earlier estimates. Capacity expanded rapidly during the second half of the 1990s and slowed considerably since then. The rate of industrial capacity utilization (the ratio of production to capacity) remained at a low level in the third quarter of 2003--the last full quarter of data--and was unchanged by the revision.

First, the study documents gender wage gaps are narrower in larger U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000 and 2010. Skill agglomerations are then considered to explain this. Specifically, if men and women employ heterogeneous skills, and these skills have differential productivities across city sizes, agglomerative forces may differentially reward men and women. Occupational data show that women are concentrated in jobs relatively more intensive in interactive and cognitive skills, while men are comparatively in physical skill‐intensive jobs. Decomposing the gender wage gap shows that explanatory factors (education, skills, and location) predict women would outearn men. Instead, agglomerative skill returns account for majority of the gap. These estimates suggest that even as women employ skills rewarded in agglomeration economies, they benefit less from agglomerations than men, resulting in the observed gap.",2016,2016-06-21,30,Marigee Bacolod,Naval Postgraduate School,"Regional Economics and Spatial Analysis; Urban, Neighborhood, and Segregation Studies; Labor market dynamics and wage inequality",Journal of Regional Science,06,"Bacolod, Marigee. 2016.

It decomposes changes in the variance of 1n earnings among individuals into the part due to changes in earnings among establishments and the part due to changes in earnings within-establishments and finds that much of the 1970s-2010s increase in earnings inequality results from increased dispersion of the earnings among the establishments where individuals work. It also shows that the divergence of establishment earnings occurred within and across industries and was associated with increased variance of revenues per worker.

Yet such changes may increase the demand for abortion at the same time that access to abortion has decreased, throwing into doubt the potential effect of these changes on the proportion of women who are heading families.State and county fixed-effects models were used to estimate the effects of factors influencing abortion availability--geographic access, parental notification requirements and Medicaid funding restrictions--on the county-level proportion of women heading households.The decline in geographic access to abortion providers during the 1980s accounted for a small but significant portion of the rise in the percentage of women heading families (about 2%). Restrictions on Medicaid funding for abortion accounted for about half of the increase in female headship among blacks, while new state parental notification requirements contributed modestly to the rise in the proportion of white women heading single-parent families.Welfare reform legislation and attempts to reduce the availability of abortion services in the United States appear to be working at cross-purposes. Cutbacks in access to abortion may have contributed modestly to the increase in the proportion of women heading households.This study examined whether new barriers to abortion access are likely to contribute to increased female headship in the US. State and country fixed effects models are estimated for the impact of geographic access to abortion providers, notification requirements, parental consent, and Medicaid funding restrictions. Data were obtained from county records from summary tape files of the 1980 and 1990 censuses; abortion provider information from the Alan Guttmacher Institute; and physicians active in OB-GYN patient care data from the Bureau of Health Professionals Area Resource File. Pooled data amounted to 6132 observations for 3066 counties. The data included nonmarital births without a marriage and marital births followed by separation or divorce. Sensitivity analysis accounted for local divorce rates. Fixed effects controls accounted for unobserved variables. Population-weighted descriptive statistics are provided for dependent and key independent variables. Abortion provider declines ranged from 13% to 19%. Findings indicate that declines in geographic access accounted for a small, but significant, decline in increased female headship. About 50% of the increase among Black female headship was accounted for by restrictions on Medicaid funding. A modest amount of the rise in White female headship was due to state parent notification requirements. The difference in the estimated impact of abortion providers in the state and county specific models supported findings of Kane and Staiger. Sensitivity models did not alter the effects of access to abortion providers and physicians. Findings suggest conflicting or competing public policy goals.",1998,1998-11-01,30,Daniel T. Lichter; D.

Some, including new work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs), were intended to promote self-sufficiency, while others, including easier application and recertification procedures, were intended to increase participation among underserved groups, such as the disabled and the elderly. Despite their relevance to policymakers, adult-only households have been examined by only a few studies. We use administrative records from South Carolina and event-history methods to investigate how spells of food stamp participation for adult-only households vary with ABAWD provisions, recertification intervals, economic conditions and other characteristics. We find that households that were subject to ABAWD policies had shorter spells and lower rates of food stamp participation than other households. We also find that households were much more likely to leave the Food Stamp Program at recertification dates than at other dates. Compared to married households, exit rates were lower for households in high unemployment areas, for female- and black-headed households, for individuals with less education, and for never-married households. We further find that the time limit was associated with exits with and without earnings, suggesting that this policy increased self-sufficiency for some households but left others without support.",2009,2009-09-01,0,David C.

Significant state-level antitrust activity may be an indicator of a perceived adverse business environment and it is found to deter establishment entry, particularly for larger firms in the retail and wholesale sectors. An obvious question is whether establishment exit is affected in a symmetric way, or whether sunk costs of market entry may lead to a smaller impact in terms of the exit decisions. We first combine US Census establishment exit panel data with data for 1998-2006 on US state-level antitrust activity and other measures of state-level business activities that may affect establishment exit. We also consider establishment exit across different broad industry types -- manufacturing, retail and wholesale -- and several firm size categories. Local business cycle factors seem to be the primary driver of exit, though there is some evidence of political and antitrust determinants as well. In another approach, we examine firm-level exit decisions and the extent to which these respond to state antitrust enforcement, with some indication of antitrust enforcement effects here as well, especially in the wholesale and retail sectors.",2013,2013-01-01,0,Robert M.

We show that the mortgage expansion was shared across the entire income distribution; that is, the flow and stock of debt rose across all income groups (except for the top 5%). The mortgage expansion was especially pronounced in areas with increased house prices, and the speed at which houses turned over (churn) in these areas went up significantly. However, the average loan-to-value ratios (LTV) at origination did not increase over the boom period. While homeownership rates increased for the middle- and upper-income households, there was no increase in homeownership for the lowest income groups. Finally, default rates postcrisis went up predominantly in areas with large house price drops, especially for high-income and high-FICO borrowers. These results are consistent with a view that the run-up in mortgage debt over the precrisis period was driven by rising home values and expectations of increasing prices.",2018,2018-04-01,43,Manuel Adelino; Antoinette Schoar; Felipe Severino,Duke University; Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology; Dartmouth Hospital; Dartmouth College,"Housing Market and Economics; Housing, Finance, and Neoliberalism; Financial Literacy, Pension, Retirement Analysis",NBER Macroeconomics Annual,04,"Adelino, Manuel; Schoar, Antoinette; Severino, Felipe. 2018.

This year, the SAC selected topics based on their synergistic effect or ability to ignite exponential positive change when addressed as a whole. For the 2019 Student Debates, the SAC SDS identified these topic areas for teams to debate and unbiased introduction speakers to address: 1) how to better communicate science to engage the public, particularly in the area of integrated pest management (IPM), 2) the influential impacts of climate change on agriculturally and medically relevant insect pests, and 3) sustainable agriculture techniques that promote the use of IPM to promote food security. Three unbiased introduction speakers gave a foundation for our audience to understand each debate topic, while each of six debate teams provided a strong case to support their stance or perspective on a topic. Debate teams submitted for a competitive spot for the annual ESA Student Debates and trained for the better part of a year to showcase their talents in presenting logical arguments for a particular topic. Both the debate teams and unbiased introduction speakers provided their insight toward a better understanding of the complexities of each topic and established a foundation to delve further into the topics of science advocacy and communication, climate change, and the many facets of integrated pest management.",2020,2020-07-17,2,Jocelyn R.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 produced updated and comprehensive demographic assessments of the key indicators of fertility, mortality, migration, and population for 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations from 1950 to 2019. <h3>Methods</h3> 8078 country-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 938 surveys, 349 censuses, and 238 other sources were identified and used to estimate age-specific fertility. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate age-specific fertility rates for 5-year age groups between ages 15 and 49 years. With extensions to age groups 10–14 and 50–54 years, the total fertility rate (TFR) was then aggregated using the estimated age-specific fertility between ages 10 and 54 years. 7417 sources were used for under-5 mortality estimation and 7355 for adult mortality. ST-GPR was used to synthesise data sources after correction for known biases. Adult mortality was measured as the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years based on vital registration, sample registration, and sibling histories, and was also estimated using ST-GPR. HIV-free life tables were then estimated using estimates of under-5 and adult mortality rates using a relational model life table system created for GBD, which closely tracks observed age-specific mortality rates from complete vital registration when available. Independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated by an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance and other sources were incorporated into the estimates in countries with large epidemics. Annual and single-year age estimates of net migration and population for each country and territory were generated using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model that analysed estimated age-specific fertility and mortality rates along with 1250 censuses and 747 population registry years. We classified location-years into seven categories on the basis of the natural rate of increase in population (calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate) and the net migration rate. We computed healthy life expectancy (HALE) using years lived with disability (YLDs) per capita, life tables, and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty was propagated throughout the demographic estimation process, including fertility, mortality, and population, with 1000 draw-level estimates produced for each metric. <h3>Findings</h3> The global TFR decreased from 2·72 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·66–2·79) in 2000 to 2·31 (2·17–2·46) in 2019. Global annual livebirths increased from 134·5 million (131·5–137·8) in 2000 to a peak of 139·6 million (133·0–146·9) in 2016. Global livebirths then declined to 135·3 million (127·2–144·1) in 2019. Of the 204 countries and territories included in this study, in 2019, 102 had a TFR lower than 2·1, which is considered a good approximation of replacement-level fertility. All countries in sub-Saharan Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27·1% (95% UI 26·4–27·8) of global livebirths. Global life expectancy at birth increased from 67·2 years (95% UI 66·8–67·6) in 2000 to 73·5 years (72·8–74·3) in 2019. The total number of deaths increased from 50·7 million (49·5–51·9) in 2000 to 56·5 million (53·7–59·2) in 2019. Under-5 deaths declined from 9·6 million (9·1–10·3) in 2000 to 5·0 million (4·3–6·0) in 2019. Global population increased by 25·7%, from 6·2 billion (6·0–6·3) in 2000 to 7·7 billion (7·5–8·0) in 2019. In 2019, 34 countries had negative natural rates of increase; in 17 of these, the population declined because immigration was not sufficient to counteract the negative rate of decline. Globally, HALE increased from 58·6 years (56·1–60·8) in 2000 to 63·5 years (60·8–66·1) in 2019. HALE increased in 202 of 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019. <h3>Interpretation</h3> Over the past 20 years, fertility rates have been dropping steadily and life expectancy has been increasing, with few exceptions. Much of this change follows historical patterns linking social and economic determinants, such as those captured by the GBD Socio-demographic Index, with demographic outcomes. More recently, several countries have experienced a combination of low fertility and stagnating improvement in mortality rates, pushing more populations into the late stages of the demographic transition. Tracking demographic change and the emergence of new patterns will be essential for global health monitoring. <h3>Funding</h3> Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",2020,2020-10-01,1452,Haidong Wang; Kaja Abbas; Mitra Abbasifard; Mohsen Abbasi‐Kangevari; Hedayat Abbastabar; Foad Abd-Allah; Ahmed Abdelalim; Hassan Abolhassani; Lucas Guimarães Abreu; Michael R.M.

To date, internationally available estimates of population and fertility, although useful, have not been produced with transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised estimates of mortality. We present single-calendar year and single-year of age estimates of fertility and population by sex with standardised and replicable methods.MethodsWe estimated population in 195 locations by single year of age and single calendar year from 1950 to 2017 with standardised and replicable methods. We based the estimates on the demographic balancing equation, with inputs of fertility, mortality, population, and migration data. Fertility data came from 7817 location-years of vital registration data, 429 surveys reporting complete birth histories, and 977 surveys and censuses reporting summary birth histories. We estimated age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs; the annual number of livebirths to women of a specified age group per 1000 women in that age group) by use of spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and used the ASFRs to estimate total fertility rates (TFRs; the average number of children a woman would bear if she survived through the end of the reproductive age span [age 10–54 years] and experienced at each age a particular set of ASFRs observed in the year of interest). Because of sparse data, fertility at ages 10–14 years and 50–54 years was estimated from data on fertility in women aged 15–19 years and 45–49 years, through use of linear regression. Age-specific mortality data came from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 estimates. Data on population came from 1257 censuses and 761 population registry location-years and were adjusted for underenumeration and age misreporting with standard demographic methods. Migration was estimated with the GBD Bayesian demographic balancing model, after incorporating information about refugee migration into the model prior. Final population estimates used the cohort-component method of population projection, with inputs of fertility, mortality, and migration data. Population uncertainty was estimated by use of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. With these data, we estimated the trends in population by age and sex and in fertility by age between 1950 and 2017 in 195 countries and territories.FindingsFrom 1950 to 2017, TFRs decreased by 49·4% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 46·4–52·0). The TFR decreased from 4·7 livebirths (4·5–4·9) to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·5), and the ASFR of mothers aged 10–19 years decreased from 37 livebirths (34–40) to 22 livebirths (19–24) per 1000 women. Despite reductions in the TFR, the global population has been increasing by an average of 83·8 million people per year since 1985. The global population increased by 197·2% (193·3–200·8) since 1950, from 2·6 billion (2·5–2·6) to 7·6 billion (7·4–7·9) people in 2017; much of this increase was in the proportion of the global population in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The global annual rate of population growth increased between 1950 and 1964, when it peaked at 2·0%; this rate then remained nearly constant until 1970 and then decreased to 1·1% in 2017. Population growth rates in the southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania GBD super-region decreased from 2·5% in 1963 to 0·7% in 2017, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa, population growth rates were almost at the highest reported levels ever in 2017, when they were at 2·7%. The global average age increased from 26·6 years in 1950 to 32·1 years in 2017, and the proportion of the population that is of working age (age 15–64 years) increased from 59·9% to 65·3%. At the national level, the TFR decreased in all countries and territories between 1950 and 2017; in 2017, TFRs ranged from a low of 1·0 livebirths (95% UI 0·9–1·2) in Cyprus to a high of 7·1 livebirths (6·8–7·4) in Niger. The TFR under age 25 years (TFU25; number of livebirths expected by age 25 years for a hypothetical woman who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) in 2017 ranged from 0·08 livebirths (0·07–0·09) in South Korea to 2·4 livebirths (2·2–2·6) in Niger, and the TFR over age 30 years (TFO30; number of livebirths expected for a hypothetical woman ageing from 30 to 54 years who survived the age group and was exposed to current ASFRs) ranged from a low of 0·3 livebirths (0·3–0·4) in Puerto Rico to a high of 3·1 livebirths (3·0–3·2) in Niger. TFO30 was higher than TFU25 in 145 countries and territories in 2017. 33 countries had a negative population growth rate from 2010 to 2017, most of which were located in central, eastern, and western Europe, whereas population growth rates of more than 2·0% were seen in 33 of 46 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, less than 65% of the national population was of working age in 12 of 34 high-income countries, and less than 50% of the national population was of working age in Mali, Chad, and Niger.InterpretationPopulation trends create demographic dividends and headwinds (ie, economic benefits and detriments) that affect national economies and determine national planning needs. Although TFRs are decreasing, the global population continues to grow as mortality declines, with diverse patterns at the national level and across age groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide transparent and replicable estimates of population and fertility, which can be used to inform decision making and to monitor progress.FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",2018,2018-11-01,404,Christopher J L Murray; Charlton Callender; Xie Rachel Kulikoff; Vinay Srinivasan; Degu Abate; Kalkidan Hassen Abate; Solomón Mequanente Abay; Nooshin Abbasi; Hedayat Abbastabar; Jemal Abdela; Ahmed Abdelalim; Omar Abdel‐Rahman; Alireza Abdi; Nasrin Abdoli; Ibrahim Abdollahpour; Rizwan Suliankatchi Abdulkader; Haftom Temesgen Abebe; Molla Abebe; Abebe Zegeye; Teshome Abuka Abebo; Ayenew Negesse Abejie; Victor Aboyans; Haftom Niguse Abraha; Daisy Maria Xavier de Abreu; Aklılu Abrham Roba; Laith J.

The current data provide an understanding of how businesses are organized and operate in their first four years of existence (2004 through 2007) and provide some indicators of survival and growth. Other measures describe the characteristics of the panel, such as the extent to which these businesses are involved in innovative activities. A series of eleven tables give a broad overview of the business and owner characteristics and firm survival over the period, as well as some new information available in the third follow-up survey. Highlights include: External debt markets remain critically important for most new firms; Only about 12 percent of firms submitted new external credit applications for debt financing in 2007; Less than 10 percent of firms owned by African Americans applied for new credit in 2007, compared with nearly 13 percent of firms owned by non-Hispanic whites; About 90 percent of firms that began operations in 2004 survived through 2005, while about 80 percent survived through 2006 and 73.4 percent through 2007. Most of the remaining firms closed either permanently or temporarily over the period, while a small number, 3.5 percent, either merged with or were sold to another business; Surviving firms with employees, which are now three years old, increased average employment from 4.6 employees in 2004 to 6.7 employees in 2007; By 2007, about 40 percent of firms had revenues greater than $100,000, compared with just 17 percent in 2004; About 60 percent of surviving firms posted profits in 2007, compared with about 40 percent posting losses; Young firms are serving local and international markets; More than a quarter of firms sold at least some of their goods or services on the Internet. Nearly a quarter of those firms had Internet sales that were more than half of their total sales, while about a third of them said Internet sales were less than 5 percent of their total sales; About 60 percent of firms felt that they had a comparative advantage in the products or services that they offered.",2009,2009-01-01,48,Alicia Robb; Janice Ballou; David DesRoches; Frank Potter; Zhanyun Zhao; E.

Yet existing models of informal finance better fit “informal moneylenders” insomuch as they fail to match two salient characteristics of family finance: family investors often accept below-market or even negative returns, and despite this, borrowers tend to prefer formal finance. We explain both of these characteristics in a model of external financing that allows for social preferences between relatives or friends. The social preferences make family finance cheap but also create shadow costs that nonetheless discourage its use: Committing family funds to a risky investment crowds out familial transfers in low-consumption states, and undermines limited liability. The very characteristics that generate intra-family insurance thus render family finance a poor source of risk capital. In contexts where contracts must harness social ties to overcome capital constraints, our findings suggest that third-party intermediation and semi-formalization may be crucial for promoting risky investment. This is relevant to the limited success of group-based microfinance in generating entrepreneurial growth, and to the emergence of social lending intermediaries and crowd funding.",2012,2012-01-01,11,Samuel Lee; Petra Persson,European Corporate Governance Institute; Swedish House of Finance; Santa Clara University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics; Stanford University,"Microfinance and Financial Inclusion; Gender, Labor, and Family Dynamics; Taxation and Compliance Studies",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Lee, Samuel; Persson, Petra. 2012.

Longitudinal data from the Integrated Longitudinal Business Database (iLBD), Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS), and the Growing America through Entrepreneurship (GATE) experiment are used to provide some of the first evidence in the literature on the determinants of taking the leap from a non-employer to employer firm among startups. Several interesting patterns emerge regarding the dynamics of non-employer startups hiring their first employee. Hiring rates among the universe of non-employer startups are very low, but increase when the population of non-employers is focused on more growth-oriented businesses such as incorporated and EIN businesses. If non-employer startups hire, the bulk of hiring occurs in the first few years of existence. After this point in time relatively few non-employer startups hire an employee. Focusing on more growth-and employment-oriented startups in the KFS, we find that Asian-owned and Hispanic-owned startups have higher rates of hiring their first employee than white-owned startups. Female-owned startups are roughly 10 percentage points less likely to hire their first employee by the first, second and seventh years after startup. The education level of the owner, however, is not found to be associated with the probability of hiring an employee. Among business characteristics, we find evidence that business assets and intellectual property are associated with hiring the first employee. Using data from the largest random experiment providing entrepreneurship training in the United States ever conducted, we do not find evidence that entrepreneurship training increases the likelihood that non-employers hire their first employee.",2016,2016-01-01,1,Robert W.

The Benefits of Workplace Innovation,"Using a unique nationally representative sample of U.S. establishments surveyed in both 1993 and 1996, we examine the relationship between workplace innovations and establishment productivity and wages. Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we find evidence that high-performance workplace practices are associated with both higher productivity and higher wages. Specifically, we find a positive and significant relationship between the proportion of non-managers using computers and the productivity of establishments. We find that firms re-engineer their workplaces and incorporate more high-performance practices experience higher productivity. For example, profit sharing is associated with increased productivity, and employee voice has a large positive effect on productivity when it is implemented in the context of unionized establishments. These workplace practices appear to explain a large part of the movement in multifactor productivity over the 1993-96 period. When we examine the determinants of wages within these establishments, we find that re-engineering a workplace to incorporate more high-performance practices leads to higher wages. However, increasing the usage of profit sharing results in lower regular pay for workers, especially technical workers and clerical/sales workers. Finally, increasing the percentage of workers meeting regularly in groups has a larger positive effect on wages in unionized establishments.",2001,2001-01-01,54,Sandra E. Black; Lisa M.

In this article, Paul Osterman reviews research on the quality of jobs and recent debates over “High Road” and “Low Road” approaches to employment practices. Scholars and policy advocates frequently utilize the distinction between High Road and Low Road firms as a framework for efforts to improve the quality of work in low-wage employers. This article assesses the logic and evidence that underlies this construct. The author provides a definition of the concept and examines the evidence behind the assumption that firms have a choice in how they design their employment policies. He then takes up the assertion that firms that adopt a High Road model can “do well by doing good” and adds precision to this claim by reviewing the evidence that a profit-maximizing firm would benefit from following the High Road path.

Using a 1981–1995 panel data set of all public and private manufacturing establishments in Indonesia, we analyze whether public-sector inefficiency is primarily due to agency-type problems or to the environment in which public-sector enterprises (PSEs) operate, as measured by the soft budget constraint and the degree of internal and external competition. The results, obtained from fixed-effects specifications, provide support for both models. Ownership matters because, for a given level of government financing or competition, PSEs perform worse than their private-sector counterparts. The environment matters because only PSEs which received government financing or those shielded from import competition or foreign ownership performed worse than private enterprises. The results suggest that the efficiency of PSEs can be increased through privatization, through manipulation of the environment, or through a combination of both approaches.",2005,2005-02-01,152,Ann P.

In practice, low-wage workers are seldom either low-skill or low-income workers.

We distinguish formal and slum construction technologies; in contrast to slums, formal structures can be built tall, are durable, and non-malleable. As the city grows areas are initially developed informally, then formally, and then redeveloped periodically. Slums are modelled as a technology choice; however, institutional frictions in land markets may hinder their conversion to formal usage that requires secure property rights. Using unique data on Nairobi for 2003 and 2015, we develop a novel set of facts that support assumptions of the model, estimate all parameters of the model, and calculate welfare losses of conversion frictions. We track the dynamic evolution of the city and compare it with model predictions. In the core city formal sector, about a third of buildings were torn down over 12 years and replaced by buildings on average three times higher. For slums in older areas near the centre, even after buying out slumlords, overcoming institutional frictions would yield gains amounting to about ${\$}$18,000 per slum household, thirty times typical annual slum rent payments.",2020,2020-07-27,54,J.

Second, we characterize the evolution of the size distribution of cities, documenting growth in sizes and numbers of cities. We ask whether the relative size distribution of cities has remained stable over time, or if it has displayed, instead, a tendency to collapse, flatten, or otherwise change its shape. We also examine evidence on whether the size distribution obeys Zipf's Law.

Immigrant segregation declined in the first part of the century, but has been rising over the past few decades. Recent immigrants tend to hail from countries with greater cultural distinctions from U.S. natives, whether economic, racial, or linguistic. These factors explain much of the increase in segregation after 1970. Evidence also points to changes in urban form, particularly native-driven suburbanization and the decline of public transit as a transportation mode, as an explanation for the new immigrant segregation.",2008,2008-07-22,163,David Cutler; Edward L.

The model predicts that positive local income shocks (i) increase the city's share of multi-family housing in new construction and (ii) lead to the construction of smaller units. We exploit the metro area samples of the American Housing Survey from 1984 to 2004 and find support for both predictions. We confirm that the adjustment process is driven by migration and is hindered by strict local land use control. Our findings imply that tight regulation may hamper metro area level labor market adjustment to positive economic shocks not only through limits on the quantity of newly supplied units but also by constraining their type to single-family houses and larger units that may be less suitable for would-be-migrants.,2014,2014-01-01,4,Christian A.

The effects are economically large -- mobility is almost 50 percent lower for owners with negative equity in their homes. This finding does not imply that current concerns over defaults and homeowners having to relocate are entirely misplaced. It does indicate that, in the past, the mortgage lock-in effects of these two factors were dominant over time.

To study the relationship between greenness and cardiovascular disease, we examined the association between residential greenness and biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and disease risk in susceptible individuals. Methods and Results In this cross‐sectional study of 408 individuals recruited from a preventive cardiology clinic, we measured biomarkers of cardiovascular injury and risk in participant blood and urine. We estimated greenness from satellite‐derived normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) in zones with radii of 250 m and 1 km surrounding the participants’ residences. We used generalized estimating equations to examine associations between greenness and cardiovascular disease biomarkers. We adjusted for residential clustering, demographic, clinical, and environmental variables. In fully adjusted models, contemporaneous NDVI within 250 m of participant residence was inversely associated with urinary levels of epinephrine (−6.9%; 95% confidence interval, −11.5, −2.0/0.1 NDVI ) and F2‐isoprostane (−9.0%; 95% confidence interval, −15.1, −2.5/0.1 NDVI ). We found stronger associations between NDVI and urinary epinephrine in women, those not on β‐blockers, and those who had not previously experienced a myocardial infarction. Of the 15 subtypes of circulating angiogenic cells examined, 11 were inversely associated (8.0–15.6% decrease/0.1 NDVI ), whereas 2 were positively associated (37.6–45.8% increase/0.1 NDVI ) with contemporaneous NDVI . Conclusions Independent of age, sex, race, smoking status, neighborhood deprivation, statin use, and roadway exposure, residential greenness is associated with lower levels of sympathetic activation, reduced oxidative stress, and higher angiogenic capacity.",2018,2018-12-05,149,Ray Yeager; Daniel W.

This article identifies limits to the local role in homeland security by analyzing a case study of Dearborn, Michigan. Partly because Dearborn is home to one of the largest concentrations of Arabs in the United States, its experience with homeland security highlights two kinds of burdens that cities incur when they engage in proactive surveillance to identify potential terrorists: damage to their reputation (since police surveillance implies that its objects are not trustworthy) and damage to police legitimacy (since new surveillance may undermine trust between police and the community). Because the benefits of efforts to identify terrorists typically accrue to jurisdictions other than the one that engages in it—unlike street crime, terrorism is a national or even international problem—local governments have little reason to pursue it. Instead, cities such as Dearborn have reason to emphasize what I call the “community protection” aspects of homeland security, such as target hardening and emergency response. This finding has more general implications for our understanding of the police role and the politics of policing, showing how both are shaped by the structural location police occupy in federalist systems of government.",2005,2005-08-25,156,David Thacher,University of Michigan,"Policing Practices and Perceptions; Crime Patterns and Interventions; Migration, Refugees, and Integration",Law & Society Review,08,"Thacher, David. 2005.

VZV can reactivate to cause herpes zoster (shingles), a debilitating disease that affects one million individuals in the US alone annually. Current vaccines against varicella (Varivax) and herpes zoster (Zostavax) are not 100% efficacious. Specifically, studies have shown that 1 dose of varivax can lead to breakthrough varicella, albeit rarely, in children and a 2-dose regimen is now recommended. Similarly, although Zostavax results in a 50% reduction in HZ cases, a significant number of recipients remain at risk. To design more efficacious vaccines, we need a better understanding of the immune response to VZV. Clinical observations suggest that T cell immunity plays a more critical role in the protection against VZV primary infection and reactivation. However, no studies to date have directly tested this hypothesis due to the scarcity of animal models that recapitulate the immune response to VZV. We have recently shown that SVV infection of rhesus macaques models the hallmarks of primary VZV infection in children. In this study, we used this model to experimentally determine the role of CD4, CD8 and B cell responses in the resolution of primary SVV infection in unvaccinated animals. Data presented in this manuscript show that while CD20 depletion leads to a significant delay and decrease in the antibody response to SVV, loss of B cells does not alter the severity of varicella or the kinetics/magnitude of the T cell response. Loss of CD8 T cells resulted in slightly higher viral loads and prolonged viremia. In contrast, CD4 depletion led to higher viral loads, prolonged viremia and disseminated varicella. CD4 depleted animals also had delayed and reduced antibody and CD8 T cell responses. These results are similar to clinical observations that children with agammaglobulinemia have uncomplicated varicella whereas children with T cell deficiencies are at increased risk of progressive varicella with significant complications. Moreover, our studies indicate that CD4 T cell responses to SVV play a more critical role than antibody or CD8 T cell responses in the control of primary SVV infection and suggest that one potential mechanism for enhancing the efficacy of VZV vaccines is by eliciting robust CD4 T cell responses.",2011,2011-11-10,88,Kristen Haberthur; Flora Engelmann; Park Byng; Alex Barron; Alfred W.

We construct pairwise Ellison-Glaeser coagglomeration indices for U.S. occupations and use these measures to investigate the factors influencing the geographic concentration of occupations. The analysis is conducted separately at the metropolitan area and state levels of geography. Empirical results reveal that occupations with similar knowledge requirements tend to coagglomerate and that the importance of this shared knowledge is larger in metropolitan areas than in states. These findings are robust to instrumental variables estimation that relies on an instrument set characterizing the means by which people typically acquire knowledge. An extension to the main analysis finds that, when we focus on metropolitan areas, the largest effects on coagglomeration are due to shared knowledge about the subjects of engineering and technology, arts and humanities, manufacturing and production, and mathematics and science.",2013,2013-01-01,2,Todd Gabe; Jaison R.

Results from age-period-cohort models show a strong negative effect of age and relatively high levels of support for legalization among baby boom cohorts. Despite the baby boom effect, the large increase in support for marijuana legalization is predominantly a broad, period-based change in the population. Additional analyses demonstrate that differences in support for legalization by education, region, and religion decline, that differences by political party increase, and that differences between whites and African Americans reverse direction.

This research, however, is largely silent as to any possible nonlinear effects. Yet social theory offers sound reasons for why the immigration–crime association may be nonlinear; explanations, including immigrant/ethnic enclave theory and immigrant victimization theory, underscore potential concentration effects—albeit in different ways. Using a novel dataset with information on crime in over 15,000 neighbourhoods across a diverse range of US cities, we examine whether or not the immigration–crime association is nonlinear. We find that for both violent and property crime, a nonlinear relationship best captures the relationship.

As a private school, St. Malachy serves the public good by recruiting and retaining such traditionally marginalized students. As empirical studies involving Catholic schools frequently juxtapose them with public schools, the author presents this examination from a different tack. Neither vilifying nor glorifying Catholic schooling, this study critically examines the pursuit of social justice in this school context. Data gathered through a 1-year study show that formal and informal leaders in St. Malachy adapted their governance, aggressively sought community resources, and focused their professional development to build the capacity to serve their increasingly pluralistic student population. The analysis confirms the deepening realization that striving toward social justice is a messy, contradictory, and complicated pursuit, and that schools in both public and private sectors are allies in this pursuit.",2010,2010-05-07,12,Martin Scanlan,Marquette University,Religious Education and Schools; Diverse Education Studies and Reforms; Pasture and Agricultural Systems,Education and Urban Society,05,"Scanlan, Martin. 2010.

They also strive to release data that are informative for a wide range of secondary analyses. Achieving both objectives is particularly challenging when data stewards seek to release highly resolved geographical information. We present an approach for protecting the confidentiality of data with geographic identifiers based on multiple imputation. The basic idea is to convert geography to latitude and longitude, estimate a bivariate response model conditional on attributes, and simulate new latitude and longitude values from these models. We illustrate the proposed methods using data describing causes of death in Durham, North Carolina.

We present an application of the synthetic data plus verification server approach to longitudinal data on employees of the U.S. federal government. As part of the application, we present a novel model for generating synthetic career trajectories, as well as strategies for generating high dimensional, longitudinal synthetic datasets. We also present novel verification algorithms for regression coefficients that satisfy differential privacy.

Family or unpaid caregivers play an important role in supporting Veterans to achieve this goal. Effectively meeting the needs of Veterans and caregivers requires identifying unmet needs and relevant gaps in resources to address those needs. Methods Using a modified Socio‐Ecological Model, we developed a prospective longitudinal panel design survey. We randomly selected 20,000 community‐dwelling Veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), across five VHA sites. We oversampled Veterans with a higher predicted 2‐year long‐term institutional care (LTIC) risk. Veterans were mailed a packet containing a Veteran survey and a caregiver survey, to be answered by their caregiver if they had one. The Veteran survey assessed the following health‐related domains: physical, mental, social determinants of health, and caregiver assistance. Caregivers completed questions regarding their demographic factors, caregiving activities, impact of caregiving, use of VA and non‐VA services, and caregiver support resources. Follow‐up surveys will be repeated twice at 12‐month intervals for the same respondents. This article describes the HERO CARE survey protocol, content, and response rates. Results We received responses from 8,056 Veterans and 3,579 caregivers between July 2021 and January 2022, with 95.6% being received via mail. Veteran respondents were mostly males (96.5%), over 65 years of age (94.9%), married (55.0%), Non‐Hispanic White (75.2%), and residing in urban areas (80.7%). Conclusions This longitudinal survey is unique in its comprehensive assessment of domains relevant to older Veterans stratified by LTIC risk and their caregivers, focusing on social determinants, caregiver support, and the use of caregiver support resources. Survey data will be linked to Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and VA data. The results of this study will inform better planning of non‐institutional care services and policy for Veterans and their caregivers.",2023,2023-09-12,3,Stuti Dang; Sandra Garcia‐Davis; Polly Hitchcock Noël; Jared Hansen; Ben J.

The distribution of these species is largely driven by both human movement and the presence of suitable climate. Using statistical mapping techniques, we show that human movement patterns explain the spread of both species in Europe and the United States following their introduction. We find that the spread of Ae. aegypti is characterized by long distance importations, while Ae. albopictus has expanded more along the fringes of its distribution. We describe these processes and predict the future distributions of both species in response to accelerating urbanization, connectivity and climate change. Global surveillance and control efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses must consider the so far unabated spread of these mosquitos. Our maps and predictions offer an opportunity to strategically target surveillance and control programmes and thereby augment efforts to reduce arbovirus burden in human populations globally.",2019,2019-03-04,1028,Moritz U.

However, impacts on accumulation may differ as a result of the timing and frequency of unemployment spells. We hypothesize that unemployment is more likely during periods in which the equities market experiences greater than average returns, largely due to a lead/lag structure of the stock and labor markets, respectively. This would imply that workers may systematically miss opportunities to purchase equities through DC plans when prices are relatively low. To test this hypothesis, we match historic stock returns to stochastically generated unemployment spells for men and women across the earnings distribution. We find lower income workers suffer greater percentage losses in retirement savings as a result of more frequent spells of unemployment.

These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public—and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms.

Population cancer screening rates are suboptimal and many cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, which results in increased morbidity and mortality. Younger populations are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage, and this age disparity is not well understood. We examine the associations between late-stage breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnoses and multilevel factors, focusing on individual state regulations of insurance and health practitioners, and interactions between such policies and age. We expect state-level regulations are significant predictors of the rates of late-stage diagnosis among younger adults. We included adults of all ages, with BC or CRC diagnosed between 2004 –2009, obtained from a newly available cancer population database covering 98 % of all known new cancer cases. We included personal characteristics, linked with a set of county and state-level predictors based on residence. We applied multilevel models to robustly examine differences in risk of late-stage cancer diagnosis across age groups (defined as age 65+ or < 65), focusing specifically on the effects of state regulatory factors and their interactions with age. Late stage BC diagnoses range from 24 %-36 %, while CRC diagnoses range from 54 %-60 % of newly diagnosed BC or CRC cases across states. After controlling statistically for many confounding factors at three levels, age < 65 is the largest person-level predictor for CRC, while black race is the largest predictor for BC. State regulations of health markets exhibit significant interactions with age groups. The state regulatory climate is an important predictor of late-stage BC and CRC diagnoses, especially among people younger than Medicare eligible age (65). State regulations can enhance the climate of access for younger, less well-insured or uninsured persons who fall outside normative screening guidelines.",2015,2015-07-14,13,Lee R.

Thus, high rates of admissions for ACSCs among the elderly (persons aged 65 or above who qualify for Medicare health insurance) are signals of poor preventive care utilization. The relevant geographic market to use in studying these admission rates is the primary care physician market. Our conceptual model assumes that local market conditions serving as interventions along the pathways to preventive care services utilization can impact ACSC admission rates. We examine the relationships between market-level supply and demand factors on market-level rates of ACSC admissions among the elderly residing in the U.S. in the late 1990s. Using 6,475 natural markets in the mainland U.S. defined by The Health Resources and Services Administration's Primary Care Service Area Project, spatial regression is used to estimate the model, controlling for disease severity using detailed information from Medicare claims files. Our evidence suggests that elderly living in impoverished rural areas or in sprawling suburban places are about equally more likely to be admitted for ACSCs. Greater availability of physicians does not seem to matter, but greater prevalence of non-physician clinicians and international medical graduates, relative to U.S. medical graduates, does seem to reduce ACSC admissions, especially in poor rural areas. The relative importance of non-physician clinicians and international medical graduates in providing primary care to the elderly in geographic areas of greatest need can inform the ongoing debate regarding whether there is an impending shortage of physicians in the United States. These findings support other authors who claim that the existing supply of physicians is perhaps adequate, however the distribution of them across the landscape may not be optimal. The finding that elderly who reside in sprawling urban areas have access impediments about equal to residents of poor rural communities is new, and demonstrates the value of conceptualizing and modelling impedance based on place and local context.",2006,2006-01-01,133,Lee R.

During the same period, employment rates for men with work limitations showed substantial declines in both absolute and relative terms. While the timing of these trends suggests that the expansion of DI was a major contributor to employment decline among this group, raising questions about the targeting of disability benefits, studies using denied applicants suggest a more modest role of the DI expansion. To reconcile these findings, we decompose total employment changes into population and employment changes for three categories: DI beneficiaries, denied applicants, and non-applicants. Our results show that during the early 1990s, the growth in DI can fully explain the employment decline for men only under an extreme assumption about the employment potential of beneficiaries. For the period after the mid-1990s, we find little role for the DI program in explaining the continuing employment decline for men with work limitations.

Multiple measures of rurality used in the biomedical and public health literature can help assess rural-urban health disparities and may impact the observed associations between rurality and health. Furthermore, understanding what makes a place truly ""rural"" versus ""urban"" may vary from region to region in the United States. Purpose: The objectives of this study are to compare and contrast five common measures of rurality and determine how well-correlated these measures are at the national, regional, and divisional level, as well as to assess patterns in the correlations between the prevalence of obesity in the population aged 60+ and each of the five measures of rurality at the regional and divisional level. Methods: Five measures of rurality were abstracted from the US Census and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to characterize US counties. Obesity data in the population aged 60+ were abstracted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Spearman's rank correlations were used to quantify the associations among the five rurality measurements at the national, regional, and divisional level, as defined by the US Census Bureau. Geographic information systems were used to visually illustrate temporal, spatial, and regional variability. Results: Overall, Spearman's rank correlations among the five measures ranged from 0.521 (percent urban-Urban Influence Code) to 0.917 (Rural-Urban Continuum Code-Urban Influence Code). Notable discrepancies existed in these associations by Census region and by division. The associations between measures of rurality and obesity in the 60+ population varied by rurality measure used and by region. Conclusion: This study is among the first to systematically assess the spatial, temporal, and regional differences and similarities among five commonly used measures of rurality in the United States. There are important, quantifiable distinctions in defining what it means to be a rural county depending on both the geographic region and the measurement used. These findings highlight the importance of developing and selecting an appropriate rurality metric in health research.",2015,2015-11-25,16,Steven A. Cohen; Lauren Kelley; Allison E.

Design: A retrospective cross-sectional regression analysis via the Fama-MacBeth procedure is adopted. Setting: We use the data for COVID-19 daily symptom-onset cases for 100 Chinese cities and COVID-19 daily confirmed cases for 1,005 U.S. counties. Participants: A total of 69,498 cases in China and 740,843 cases in the U.S. are used for calculating the effective reproductive numbers. Primary outcome measures: Regression analysis of the impact of temperature and relative humidity on the effective reproductive number (R value). Results: Statistically significant negative correlations are found between temperature/relative humidity and the effective reproductive number (R value) in both China and the U.S. Conclusions: Higher temperature and higher relative humidity potentially suppress the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, an increase in temperature by 1 degree Celsius is associated with a reduction in the R value of COVID-19 by 0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and by 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.; an increase in relative humidity by 1% is associated with a reduction in the R value by 0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and by 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S. Therefore, the potential impact of temperature/relative humidity on the effective reproductive number alone is not strong enough to stop the pandemic.",2021,2021-02-01,148,Jingyuan Wang; Ke Tang; Kai Feng; Xin Lin; Weifeng Lv; Kun Chen; Fei Wang,Beihang University; Beijing Advanced Sciences and Innovation Center; Tsinghua University; Institute of Economics; Beihang University; Beihang University; Beihang University; UConn Health; University of Connecticut; Cornell University,COVID-19 epidemiological studies; COVID-19 Impact on Reproduction; COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts,BMJ Open,02,"Wang, Jingyuan; Tang, Ke; Feng, Kai; Lin, Xin; Lv, Weifeng; Chen, Kun; Wang, Fei. 2021.

Transit investments improve communities’ mobility and access, and may improve health with reduced driving. However, there is also the potential for transit-oriented development (TOD) to spur gentrification and displacement if affordable housing is lost. Understanding transit corridor conditions and change with new infrastructure is important for learning how to mitigate negative effects and support inclusive communities with access to transit for lower-income households. The planning of a new bus rapid transit line along the Powell-Division corridor in Portland-Gresham provides an opportunity to understand neighborhood impacts of transit investment and evaluate programs designed to preserve and create affordable housing; include residents in economic development on the corridor; and build livable communities in an underserved area of the region. This proposal is for a research partnership between Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning faculty and the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability to evaluate current conditions and potential for impacts of TOD, and to build a long-term program of assessment of neighborhood change and program evaluation as the city pilots new approaches to equitable TOD. The first phase will document the potential costs to communities if an integrated approach to livable communities were not taken, by assessing the risk of housing loss and displacement. DOT priorities are developing, evaluating and disseminating a coordinated approach to livable communities that includes housing and transportation. This work will speak to the scholarly debates about gentrification and public infrastructure investment, and will be presented to practitioner audiences through venues such as New Partners for Smart Growth, the PolicyLink think tank, and other learning opportunities for professionals.",2017,2017-07-07,1,Lisa K.

The History and Future of Workplace Automation,"In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor—as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a “polarization” of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization and is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.

Older workers have often been considered less productive than younger ones, raising the issue of whether an aging workforce will also be a less productive one. This paper uses evidence from the monthly Current Population Survey files to shed light on the issue. It documents the rapidly growing role of older workers in the labor market and the steady improvement in their relative earnings. Compared with earlier generations of aged Americans and compared with contemporary prime-age workers, today's elderly are unusually well educated. Their high relative earnings and later retirement are partly explained by this fact. At the same time, the paper offers evidence that more productive workers stay in the workforce longer than less productive ones. Using a standard measure of worker productivity – hourly wages – workers between 60 and 74 are more productive than average workers who are younger. Compared with workers between 25 and 59, the pay premium for older workers is currently between 10 percent and 20 percent of the average wage earned by the younger workers. That pay premium has been increasing for a decade.

We find that a 1 percentage point reduction in the local unemployment rate is associated with a roughly 0.27 percentage point reduction in the fraction of jobs requiring at least a bachelorâ€™s degree and a roughly 0.23 percentage point reduction in the fraction requiring 5 or more years of experience. This pattern is established using multiple measures of labor availability, is bolstered by similar trends along heretofore unmeasured dimensions of skill, and even occurs within firm-job title pairs. We further confirm the causal effect of labor market tightening on skill requirements using a natural experiment based on the fracking boom in the U.S. as an exogenous shock to local labor supply in tradable, non-fracking industries. These industries are not plausibly affected by local demand shocks or natural gas extraction technology, but still show fewer skill requirements in response to tighter labor markets.

The EITC in DC merits investigation, as the DC supplement to the federal credit is the largest in the nation. The supplemental DC EITC was enacted in 2000, and has been expanded from 10 percent of the federal credit in 2001 to 40 percent as of 2009. To implement the study, we estimate least squares models with 0/1 dependent variables to estimate the likelihood of net-EITC income above poverty and near-poverty thresholds. We also estimate the likelihood of earnings growth and income stabilization from the EITC. To identify the effect of the EITC, we exploit variation in the EITC subsidy rate from 2008 to 2009, when an additional EITC bracket of 45 percent was added for workers with three or more dependent children, up from 40 percent in the previous year for workers with two or more children. We also estimate a model examining the impact of city-level changes to the EITC. The structure and richness of our data enable us to control for tax filer fixed effects, an important innovation from many previous EITC studies.

This paper argues that the muted impact of credit constraints stems from the absence of a mechanism to explain the observed persistent comovements between housing prices and business investment. We develop such a mechanism by incorporating two key features into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model: We identify shocks that shift the demand for collateral assets and allow productive agents to be credit-constrained. A combination of these two features enables our model to successfully generate an empirically important mechanism that amplifies and propagates macroeconomic fluctuations through credit constraints.,2010,2010-01-01,30,Zheng Liu; Pengfei Wang; Tao Zha,Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; Emory University,"Monetary Policy and Economic Impact; Banking stability, regulation, efficiency; Economic Theory and Policy",SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Liu, Zheng; Wang, Pengfei; Zha, Tao. 2010.

At the same time, the consequences of the pandemic, such as closures, hygiene standards, or remote work arrangements, may have also altered patterns of survey participation and introduced nonresponse bias, threatening the quality of establishment survey data. To investigate these issues, this article examines fieldwork outcomes, nonresponse bias, and predictors of survey participation in the IAB-Job Vacancy Survey. As comparisons with previous survey years show, it became more difficult to successfully interview establishments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using linked administrative data, we show that nonresponse bias was higher in 2020 compared to previous years, even after applying the standard weighting adjustment. However, general patterns of survey participation in 2020 were similar to previous years and COVID-19 related measures were not strong predictors of survey participation in 2020. Further, we provide evidence that nonresponse bias during the pandemic can be reduced by incorporating additional administrative variables into the weighting procedure relative to the standard weighting variables.

We considered perceived likelihood that the pandemic would lead to civil unrest, perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission and perceptions that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated.Data were collected from 5 to 12 April 2020, shortly after Texas' stay-at-home declaration. We generated a sample using random digit dial methods for a telephone survey (n=77, response rate=8%) and by randomly selecting adults from an ongoing panel to complete the survey online (n=1120, non-probability sample). We conducted a logistic regression to estimate differences in perceptions by gun ownership. To account for bias associated with use of a non-probability sample, we used Bayesian data integration and ran linear regression models to produce more accurate measures of association.Among the 60% of Texas adults who reported gun ownership, estimates of past 7-day gun purchases, ammunition purchases and gun carrying were 15% (n=78), 20% (n=100) and 24% (n=130), respectively. We found no evidence of an association between gun ownership with perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission or with perceived likelihood of civil unrest. Results from the logistic regression (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63) and the linear regression (β=0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29) suggest that gun owners may be more likely to believe the threat of COVID-19 was exaggerated.Compared with those without guns, gun owners may have been inclined to downplay the threat of COVID-19 early in the pandemic.",2021,2021-11-01,5,Reneé M.

The complex design features of these samples improve data collection efficiency, but also require analysts to account for these features when conducting analysis. Unfortunately, many secondary analysts from fields outside of statistics, biostatistics, and survey methodology do not have adequate training in this area, and as a result may apply incorrect statistical methods when analyzing these survey data sets. This in turn could lead to the publication of incorrect inferences based on the survey data that effectively negate the resources dedicated to these surveys. In this article, we build on the results of a preliminary meta-analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal articles presenting analyses of data from a variety of national health surveys, which suggested that analytic errors may be extremely prevalent in these types of investigations. We first perform a meta-analysis of a stratified random sample of 145 additional research products analyzing survey data from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), which describes features of the U.S. Science and Engineering workforce, and examine trends in the prevalence of analytic error across the decades used to stratify the sample. We once again find that analytic errors appear to be quite prevalent in these studies. Next, we present several example analyses of real SESTAT data, and demonstrate that a failure to perform these analyses correctly can result in substantially biased estimates with standard errors that do not adequately reflect complex sample design features. Collectively, the results of this investigation suggest that reviewers of this type of research need to pay much closer attention to the analytic methods employed by researchers attempting to publish or present secondary analyses of survey data.",2016,2016-06-29,43,Brady T.

The Massachusetts Experience,"In 2006, Massachusetts passed health care reform legislation designed to achieve nearly universal coverage through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, and subsidies that later served as the model for national reform. Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we provide evidence that health care reform in Massachusetts led to better overall self-assessed health. Various robustness checks and placebo tests support a causal interpretation of the results. We also document improvements in several determinants of overall health: physical health, mental health, functional limitations, joint disorders, and body mass index. Next, we show that the effects on overall health were strongest among those with low incomes, nonwhites, near-elderly adults, and women. Finally, we use the reform to instrument for health insurance and estimate a sizeable impact of coverage on health.",2013,2013-11-12,171,Charles Courtemanche; Daniela Zapata,American Economic Association; University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Georgia; Cornell University; American Economic Association; University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Cornell University; University of Georgia,Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Primary Care and Health Outcomes,Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,11,"Courtemanche, Charles; Zapata, Daniela. 2013.

Using data from the American Community Survey between 2012 and 2017, we compare Medicaid coverage over time in 9 states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 with no previous expansion for able-bodied, working-age adults with 12 states that had not expanded Medicaid by 2019 and also had no previous expansion for such adults. A difference-in-differences model is used to formalize this comparison. Similar to many previous studies, we find that Medicaid coverage increased dramatically for income-eligible adults under 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL). In addition, we show that Medicaid participation increased by 3.0 percentage points for those with incomes above 138% of the FPL from a pre-ACA baseline of 2.7% among this group. While we cannot say with certainty why these individuals were able to participate in Medicaid, we offer several potential explanations that should be the subject of future work. For example, it is possible that the ACA Medicaid expansions were administered differently at the state or local level than federal rules would require, similarly to differences between effective tax rates and statutory tax rates in many transfer programs.",2019,2019-01-01,2,Charles Courtemanche; James Marton; Aaron Yelowitz,University of Kentucky; Georgia State University; University of Kentucky,Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Employment and Welfare Studies,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Courtemanche, Charles; Marton, James; Yelowitz, Aaron. 2019.

Data were drawn from a census of all ambulance dispatches in NYC between January 1, 2013, and July 31, 2016. Ambulance dispatches for more severe injuries, which are more difficult to characterize as unnecessary, were used as the control group. Analyses were conducted from August 17, 2017, to May, 10, 2019.The main outcome was the number of ambulance dispatches for minor injuries, defined per month per dispatch zone. The implementation of the ACA was measured using an indicator variable of 1 for dispatches starting January 1, 2014, and 0 for dispatches before January 1, 2014. The number of ambulance dispatches for injuries and major injuries was used to account for secular trends. Injury severity was classified by the dispatchers based on information from the 911 callers with a severity score on a scale of 1 to 8, where 1 is the most severe; minor injuries had a score of 7; injuries, 5; and major injuries, 3.There were 4 787 180 ambulance dispatches in NYC during the study. After the 2014 expansion of insurance coverage under the ACA, there was an increase in ambulance dispatches for minor injuries compared with dispatches for more severe injuries. Compared with the preimplementation mean (SD) of 20.75 (14.24) minor injury dispatches per dispatch zone per month, there were 7.71 (95% CI, 1.23-14.19) additional minor injury dispatches per dispatch zone per month compared with dispatches for other types of injuries, an increase of 37.2%. Given that NYC has 31 dispatch zones, this increase is equivalent to approximately 239 additional dispatches per month or 2868 additional dispatches per year for minor injuries.There was a significant increase in use of ambulance transport for minor injuries in NYC after the ACA insurance expansion, suggesting that the change in health insurance structure was associated with increased use of emergency medical services in nonemergent situations. Future reforms to the US health insurance system should take into account the potential for increased use of emergency medical services in nonemergent situations, which the literature suggests may lead to congestion and slower response times.",2019,2019-06-28,11,Charles Courtemanche; Andrew Friedson; Daniel I.

In this article, we estimate how the causal impact of the ACA on insurance coverage changed during 2017 through 2019, the first 3 years of the Trump administration, compared to 2016. Data come from the 2011-2019 waves of the American Community Survey (ACS), with the sample restricted to non-elderly adults. Our model leverages variation in treatment intensity from state Medicaid expansion decisions and pre-ACA uninsured rates. We find that the coverage gains from the components of the law that took effect nationally-such as the individual mandate and regulations and subsidies in the private non-group market-fell from 5 percentage points in 2016 to 3.6 percentage points in 2019. In contrast, the coverage gains from the Medicaid expansion increased in 2017 (7.0 percentage points) before returning to the 2016 level of coverage gains in 2019 (5.9 percentage points). The net effect of the ACA in expansion states is a combination of these trends, with coverage gains falling from 10.8 percentage points in 2016 to 9.6 percentage points in 2019.",2021,2021-01-01,4,Charles Courtemanche; Ishtiaque Fazlul; James Marton; Benjamin Ukert; Aaron Yelowitz; Daniela Zapata,National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Kentucky; Kennesaw State University; Georgia State University; Texas A&M University; University of Kentucky; Impaq International (United States),Healthcare Policy and Management; Global Health Care Issues; Primary Care and Health Outcomes,INQUIRY The Journal of Health Care Organization Provision and Financing,01,"Courtemanche, Charles; Fazlul, Ishtiaque; Marton, James; Ukert, Benjamin; Yelowitz, Aaron; Zapata, Daniela. 2021.

The spatial interconnectivity of migration is a concrete manifestation of underlying spatial interdependence among places and, as such, deserves to be explicitly unpacked to further our understanding of the migration slowdown. Using county‐to‐county migration flow data from the Internal Revenue Service and a novel application of Das Gupta's demographic standardisation and decomposition procedures, we document changes in the spatial interconnectivity of migration during the migration slowdown between 1990 and 2010. We show that counties became more connected to one another by migration over time and that the increasing spatial interconnectivity of migration helped to keep the migration slowdown from slowing further. We also document changes in the spatial interconnectivity of migration for four types of migration flows: metro‐to‐metro, nonmetro‐to‐metro, metro‐to‐nonmetro, and nonmetro‐to‐nonmetro. Our work further elucidates the characteristics of the migration slowdown by describing changes in the spatial interconnectivity of migration. It also raises new questions for future research about the determinants and consequences of these changes.",2019,2019-10-27,16,Jack DeWaard; Elizabeth Fussell; Katherine J.

In partnership with Promotoras de Salud (community health workers), we gathered household surveys nearby two oil production sites in Los Angeles. We tested the capacity of low-cost sensors for localized exposure estimates. Bilingual surveys of 205 randomly sampled residences were collected within two 1500 ft. buffer areas (West Adams and University Park) surrounding oil development sites. We used a one-sample proportion test, comparing overall rates from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) of Service Planning Area 6 (SPA6) and Los Angeles County for variables of interest such as asthma. Field calibrated low-cost sensors recorded methane emissions. Physician diagnosed asthma rates were reported to be higher within both buffers than in SPA6 or LA County. Asthma prevalence in West Adams but not University Park was significantly higher than in Los Angeles County. Respondents with diagnosed asthma reported rates of emergency room visits in the previous 12 months similar to SPA6. 45% of respondents were unaware of oil development; 63% of residents would not know how to contact local regulatory authorities. Residents often seek information about their health and site-related activities. Low-cost sensors may be useful in highlighting differences between sites or recording larger emission events and can provide localized data alongside resident-reported symptoms. Regulatory officials should help clarify information to the community on methods for reporting health symptoms.

Focusing on college graduates, we construct two direct measures of job matching based on how well an individual’s job corresponds to his or her college education. Consistent with matching-based theories of urban agglomeration, we find evidence that larger and thicker local labor markets help college graduates find better jobs by increasing both the likelihood and quality of a match. We then assess the extent to which better job matching of college-educated workers increases individual-level wages and thereby contributes to the urban wage premium.

Since then, the unemployment rate has come down steadily, and it stood at 5.8 percent in November 2014. Based on existing analyses and some new evidence, this paper establishes that much of the change in unemployment during the Great Recession and during the recovery can be attributed to cyclical factors rather than structural factors. The paper then presents new suggestive evidence to quantify the employment impacts of various counter-cyclical policies introduced during this time. We conduct a counter-factual and find that employment would have been between 4.2 percent and 4.5 percent lower had it not been because of the spending in Medicaid injected in local economies by the Recovery Act. In addition, we conduct a differences-in-differences and triple difference analysis, which suggests that the Work Opportunity Tax Credits increased the likelihood of employment by about 4.7 percent for disconnected youth but had no effect on disabled and unemployed veterans. Finally, we also find evidence that suggests that the Hiring Incentive to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act increased employment of the unemployed by 2.6 percent and that the reemployment reforms introduced in 2012 as part of the UI extensions increased employment by 6 percent for the long-term unemployed.

This study aims to find direct effects of the energy boom and indirect effects of multiple mediators—community economic conditions, population change, racial diversity, and income inequality—on local philanthropy. Methods Drawing upon data from U.S. counties, a series of mediation analyses are tested by following Baron and Kenney's (1986, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 51(6):1173) causal‐steps procedures. Results The energy boom always has negative direct effects on local philanthropy. Although indirect effects of mediators are not always significant, total effects, as the sum of direct and indirect effects, reveal that income, population growth, and racial diversity positively mediate negative effects of the energy boom on local philanthropy. The energy boom increases levels of income inequality; however, increased income inequality paradoxically is positively associated with local philanthropy. Conclusion The relationship among the energy boom, community economic and demographic conditions, and local philanthropy is complex.

The study develops a new index of access that builds on the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, and has three dimensions: a facility attractiveness index, defined by services rendered incorporated into the Huff Model; a facility catchment area, defined as a function of facility attractiveness to account for variable catchment size; and a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to account for nonspatial factors that mitigate or compound the impacts of spatial access to care. Results of the study indicate a significant variation in access to OTPs statewide. Spatial access to OTPs is low across the entire state except for in a limited number of metropolitan areas. The majority of the population with low access (85%) live in areas with a moderate-to-high levels of social vulnerability. This research provides more realistic estimates of access to care and aims to assist policymakers in better targeting disadvantaged areas for OTP program expansion and resource allocation.",2021,2021-04-16,16,Parisa Bozorgi; Jan M.

This study examines the relationship of race/ethnicity, socio-economic status (SES) and other factors upon sleep quality. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 9,714 randomly selected subjects was used to explore sleep quality obtained by self-report, in relation to socioeconomic factors including poverty, employment status, and education level. The primary outcome was poor sleep quality. Data were collected by the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation. Results Significant differences were observed in the outcome for race/ethnicity (African-American and Latino versus White: unadjusted OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.05 and OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, respectively) and income (below poverty threshold, unadjusted OR = 2.84, 95%CI 2.41-3.35). In multivariable modeling, health indicators significantly influenced sleep quality most prominently in poor individuals. After adjusting for socioeconomic factors (education, employment) and health indicators, the association of income and poor sleep quality diminished, but still persisted in poor Whites while it was no longer significant in poor African-Americans (adjusted OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.47-2.58 versus OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.87-1.54, respectively). Post-college education (adjusted OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) protected against poor sleep. Conclusions A ""sleep disparity"" exists in the study population: poor sleep quality is strongly associated with poverty and race. Factors such as employment, education and health status, amongst others, significantly mediated this effect only in poor subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to these factors in poor relative to non-poor individuals in the context of sleep quality.

In the shift to remote/distance learning, this report explores the degree to which children with disabilities did not receive the special education and related services defined in their individualized education program (IEP). Methods Patients attending an outpatient tertiary care center for neurodevelopmental disabilities in Maryland were surveyed on the impact of the pandemic on educational services provision. Results Nearly half (46%) of respondents qualified for special education and related services through an IEP before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those with IEPs, 48% attested to reduced frequency and/or duration of special education and/or related services during the pandemic. The reduction was greatest in occupational therapy services (47%), followed physical therapy services (46%), and special education services (34%). Conclusion This survey of children with disabilities observes a substantial reduction in IEP services reported in their completed surveys. To address the observed reduction in IEP services, we sought additional education for clinicians on the rights of students with disabilities in anticipation of students’ re-entry to the classroom.

We analyze this approach in a context where individuals live and work in different locations (thus facing different housing prices and wages). Our model justifies the traditional approach, but with the important caveat that the regression should include location-specific fixed effects. Empirical analysis of men in U.S. labor markets demonstrates that failure to condition on location causes us to significantly overstate the decline in black-white wage disparity over the past 60 years.

Industrial food animal production may be an important environmental reservoir for human carriage of these pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this study was to investigate environmental and occupational exposures associated with nasal carriage of MRSA in patients hospitalized at Vidant Medical Center, a tertiary hospital serving a region with intensive livestock production in eastern North Carolina. MRSA nasal carriage was identified via nasal swabs collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. MRSA carriers (cases) were gender and age matched to non-carriers (controls). Participants were interviewed about recent environmental and occupational exposures. Home addresses were geocoded and publicly available data were used to estimate the density of swine in residential census block groups of residence. Conditional logistic regression models were used to derive odds ratio (OR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Presence of the scn gene in MRSA isolates was assessed. In addition, multi locus sequence typing (MLST) of the MRSA isolates was performed, and the Diversilab® system was used to match the isolates to USA pulsed field gel electrophoresis types. From July - December 2011, 117 cases and 119 controls were enrolled. A higher proportion of controls than cases were current workforce members (41.2% vs. 31.6%) Cases had a higher odds of living in census block groups with medium densities of swine (OR: 4.76, 95% CI: 1.36-16.69) and of reporting the ability to smell odor from a farm with animals when they were home (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.80-2.86). Of 49 culture positive MRSA isolates, all were scn positive. Twenty-two isolates belonged to clonal complex 5. Absence of livestock workers in this study precluded evaluation of occupational exposures. Higher odds of MRSA in medium swine density areas could reflect environmental exposure to swine or poultry.",2014,2014-06-23,24,Leah H. Schinasi; Steve Wing; Kerri L. Augustino; Keith M.

First, we calculated the rate of truck accidents by computing the ratio of accident count and county population. When comparing counties with increased O&amp;G operations to counties with less activity, we found that counties with more activity have greater rates of truck traffic accidents per capita (Rate Ratio = 1.07, p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.13).

We then applied hurdle count models, using the accident counts as the outcomes and the number of homes and number of wells as independent variables.

The topic of childhood vaccinations has become increasingly contentious, sparking debate and challenging decisions for parents, study aimed to explore the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination plans for parents of unvaccinated children and identify the most common reasons for not vaccinating children against COVID-19 in the United States. Methods. Authors analyzed data from Phase 3.7, Week 53 of the United States Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (N = 68,504), collected from January 4 to January 16, 2023. Standard descriptive statistics and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were used to analyze the data. Results. The top three reasons given for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects, not trusting the vaccine, and children in the household not members of a high-risk group. Nearly 87% (n = 59,363) of respondents reported having received a COVID-19 vaccination, these respondents were more likely to vaccinate their children in all three age ranges studied. Participants with higher levels of education (bachelor’s degree or higher) were also more likely to vaccinate their children against COVID-19.

We apply a non-parametric method for smoothing with naive or informative priors to age distributions from the 2010 Census via demonstration data which have had the US Census Bureau's implementation of differential privacy applied. We find that smoothing age distributions can increase the fidelity of the demonstration data to previously published population counts by age.

ER is a fundamental challenge in data science, and a common barrier to ER research and development is that the data fields used for this fuzzy matching are personally identifiable information, such as name, address, and date of birth. The necessary restrictions on accessing and sharing these authentic data have slowed the work in developing, testing, and adopting new methods and software for ER. We recently released <ns3:italic>pseudopeople</ns3:italic>, a Python package that allows users to generate simulated datasets with configurable noise approaching the scale and complexity of the data on which large organizations and federal agencies, like the US Census Bureau regularly perform ER. With pseudopeople, researchers can develop new algorithms and software for ER of US population data without needing access to personal and confidential information. Methods We created the simulated population data available for noising with pseudopeople using our Vivarium simulation platform. Our model simulates individuals and their families, households, and employment dynamics over time, which we observe through simulated censuses, surveys, and administrative data collection systems. Results Our simulation process produced over 900 gigabytes of simulated censuses, surveys, and administrative data for pseudopeople, representing hundreds of millions of simulants. A sample simulated population of thousands of simulants is now openly available to all users of the pseudopeople package, and large-scale simulated populations of millions and hundreds of millions of simulants are also available by online request through GitHub. These simulated population data are structured for use by the pseudopeople package, which includes additional affordances to add various kinds of noise to the data to provide realistic, sharable challenges for ER researchers.</ns3:p>",2024,2024-10-18,1,Beatrix Haddock; Alix Pletcher; Nathaniel Blair-Stahn; Os Keyes; Matt Kappel; Steve Bachmeier; Sylvia Lutze; James Albright; Alison Bowman; Caroline Kinuthia; Zeb Burke-Conte; Rajan Mudambi; Abraham D.

For species not amenable to large laboratory breeding studies, widespread color polymorphism across natural populations offers a powerful way to assess the relative likelihood of different genetic systems given observed phenotypic frequencies. We classified color phenotype for 2175 ground snakes (Sonora semiannulata) across the continental United States to analyze morph ratios and test among competing hypotheses about the genetic architecture underlying red and black coloration in coral snake mimics. We found strong support for a two‐locus model under simple Mendelian inheritance, with red and black pigmentation being controlled by separate loci. We found no evidence of either linkage disequilibrium between loci or sex linkage. In contrast to Batesian mimicry systems such as butterflies in which all color signal components are linked into a single “supergene,” our results suggest that the mimetic signal in colubrid snakes can be disrupted through simple recombination and that color evolution is likely to involve discrete gains and losses of each signal component. Both outcomes are likely to contribute to the exponential increase in rates of color evolution seen in snake mimicry systems over insect systems.",2016,2016-03-09,14,Alison R.

Namely, county-to-county migration and commuting drop off discretely at state borders. People are three times as likely to move to a county 15 miles away, but in the same state, than to move to an equally distant county in a different state. These gaps remain even among neighboring counties or counties in the same commuting zone. This pattern is not explained by differences in county characteristics, is not driven by any particular demographic group, and is not explained by pecuniary costs such as differences in state occupational licensing, taxes, or transfer program generosity. However, county-to-county social connectedness (as measured by the number of Facebook linkages) follows a similar pattern. Although the patterns in social networks would be consistent with information frictions, nonpecuniary psychic costs, or behavioral biases such as a sate identity or home bias, the data suggest that state identity and home bias play an outsized role. This empirical pattern has real economic impacts. Building on existing methods, I show that employment in border counties adjusts more slowly after local economic shocks relative to interior counties. These counties also exhibit less in-migration and in-commuting, suggesting the lack of mobility leads to slower labor market adjustment.",2021,2021-12-02,0,Riley Wilson,Brigham Young University; W.E.

Exploiting immigrant enclaves and source-country flows of DACA-eligible immigrants to isolate plausibly exogenous variation in the concentration of DACA recipients, we show that in labor markets where more of the working-age population can access legal protection through DACA, U.S.-born workers see little-to-no change in employment rates and actually observe increases in wage earnings after DACA's implementation.

The first national performance measures (NPMs) for MCH were instituted in 1997. Changing trends in MCH risk factors, outcomes, health services, data sources, and advances in scientific knowledge, in conjunction with budgetary constraints led the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) to design a new performance measurement system.A workgroup was formed to develop a new system. The following guiding principles were used: (1) Afford States more flexibility and reduce the overall reporting burden; (2) Improve accountability to better document Title V's impact; (3) Develop NPMs that encompass measures in: maternal and women's health, perinatal health, child health, children with special health care needs, adolescent health, and cross-cutting areas.A three-tiered performance measurement system was proposed with national outcome measures (NOMs), NPMs and evidence-based/informed strategy measures (ESMs). NOMs are the ultimate goals that MCHB and States are attempting to achieve. NPMs are measures, generally associated with processes or programs, shown to affect NOMs. ESMs are evidence-based or informed measures that each State Title V program develops to affect the NPMs. There are 15 NPMs from which States select eight, with at least one from each population area. MCHB will provide the data for the NOMs and NPMs, when possible.The new performance measurement system increases the flexibility and reduces the reporting burden for States by allowing them to choose 8 NPMs to target, and increases accountability by having States develop actionable ESMs.The new national performance measure framework for maternal and child health will allow States more flexibility to address their areas of greatest need, reduce their data reporting burden by having the Maternal and Child Health Bureau provide data for the National Outcome and Performance Measures, yet afford States the opportunity to develop measurable strategies to address their selected performance measures.",2015,2015-04-01,36,Michael D.

Equity and spatial distribution of outcomes in the delivery of subsidized artemisinin-based combination therapies through private drug shops,"Millions of individuals with malaria-like fevers purchase drugs from private retailers, but artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the only effective treatment in regions with high levels of resistance to older drugs, are rarely obtained through these outlets due to their relatively high cost. To encourage scale up of ACTs, the Affordable Medicines Facility – malaria is being launched to subsidize their price. The Government of Tanzania and the Clinton Foundation piloted this subsidized distribution model in two Tanzanian districts to examine concerns about whether the intervention will successfully reach poor, rural communities. Stocking of ACTs and other antimalarial drugs in all retail shops was observed at baseline and in four subsequent surveys over 15 months. Exit interviews were conducted with antimalarial drug customers during each survey period. All shops and facilities were georeferenced, and variables related to population density and proximity to distribution hubs, roads, and other facilities were calculated. To understand the equity of impact, shops stocking ACTs and consumers buying them were compared to those that did not, according to geographic and socioeconomic variables. Patterning in ACT stocking and sales was evaluated against that of other common antimalarials to identify factors that may have impacted access. Qualitative data were used to assess motivations underlying stocking, distribution, and buying disparities. Results indicated that although total ACT purchases rose from negligible levels to nearly half of total antimalarial sales over the course of the pilot, considerable geographic variation in stocking and sales persisted and was related to a variety of socio-spatial factors; ACTs were stocked more often in shops located closer to district towns (p<0.01) and major roads (p<0.01) and frequented by individuals of higher socioeconomic status (p<0.01). However, other antimalarial drugs displayed similar patterning, indicating the existence of underlying disparities in access to antimalarial drugs in general in these districts. As this subsidy model is scaled up across multiple countries, these results confirm the potential for increased ACT usage but suggest that additional efforts to increase access in remote areas will be needed for the scale-up to have equitable impact.

We obtained publicly available data on state-only public funding for family planning and abortion services (years available: 1980, 1987, 1994, 2001, 2006, and 2010) and corresponding annual data on US county infant death rates. We modeled the funding as both fraction of state expenditures and per capita spending (per woman, age 15–44). State-level covariates comprised: Title X and Medicaid per capita funding, fertility rate, and percent of counties with no abortion services; county-level covariates were: median family income, and percent: black infants, adults without a high school education, urban, and female labor force participation. We used Possion log-linear models for: (1) repeat cross-sectional analyses, with random state and county effects; and (2) panel analysis, with fixed state effects. Four findings were robust to analytic approach. First, since 2000, the rate ratio for infant death comparing states in the top funding quartile vs. no funding for abortion services ranged (in models including all covariates) between 0.94 and 0.98 (95% confidence intervals excluding 1, except for the 2001 cross-sectional analysis, whose upper bound equaled 1), yielding an average 15% reduction in risk (range: 8–22%). Second, a similar risk reduction for state per capita funding for family planning services occurred in 1994. Third, the excess risk associated with lower county income increased over time, and fourth, remained persistently high for counties with a high percent of black infants.

The purpose of this study was to formulate projections for the number of primary and revision total hip and knee arthroplasties that will be performed in the United States through 2030.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1990 to 2003) was used in conjunction with United States Census Bureau data to quantify primary and revision arthroplasty rates as a function of age, gender, race and/or ethnicity, and census region. Projections were performed with use of Poisson regression on historical procedure rates in combination with population projections from 2005 to 2030.By 2030, the demand for primary total hip arthroplasties is estimated to grow by 174% to 572,000. The demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is projected to grow by 673% to 3.48 million procedures. The demand for hip revision procedures is projected to double by the year 2026, while the demand for knee revisions is expected to double by 2015. Although hip revisions are currently more frequently performed than knee revisions, the demand for knee revisions is expected to surpass the demand for hip revisions after 2007. Overall, total hip and total knee revisions are projected to grow by 137% and 601%, respectively, between 2005 and 2030.These large projected increases in demand for total hip and knee arthroplasties provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions related to the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons needed to perform these procedures and the deployment of appropriate resources to serve this need.",2007,2007-04-01,6613,Steven M.

The Census Bureau estimates that in 2000, 34% of all youth aged 15–19 were from minority groups; it estimates that by 2025, this will increase to 46% ( U.S. Census Bureau 2000 ). In addition, approximately one in five school-age children reside in an immigrant family ( Zhou 1997 , Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco 2001 ). We provide an overview of recent empirical research on racial, ethnic, and immigrant differences in educational achievement and attainment, and we examine some current theories that attempt to explain these differences. We explore group differences in grades, test scores, course taking, and tracking, especially throughout secondary schooling, and then discuss variation in high school completion, transitions to college, and college completion. We also summarize key theoretical explanations used to explain persistent differences net of variation in socioeconomic status, which focus on family and cultural beliefs that stem from minority group and class experiences. Overall, there are many signs of optimism. Racial and ethnic gaps in educational achievement and attainment have narrowed over the past three decades by every measure available to social scientists. Educational aspirations are universally high for all racial and ethnic groups as most adolescents expect to go to college. However, substantial gaps remain, especially between less advantaged groups such as African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans and more advantaged groups such as whites and Asian Americans. The racial and ethnic hierarchy in educational achievement is apparent across varying measures of the academic experience.",2003,2003-08-01,1355,Grace Kao; Jennifer Thompson,University of Pennsylvania; American Institutes for Research; University of Pennsylvania; American Institutes for Research,School Choice and Performance; Parental Involvement in Education; Early Childhood Education and Development,Annual Review of Sociology,08,"Kao, Grace; Thompson, Jennifer. 2003.

Data presented in this report indicate the following: • Real median household income increased between 2006 and 2007—the third annual increase.1 • The poverty rate was not statistically different between 2006 and 2007. • Both the number and the percentage of people without health insurance coverage decreased between 2006 and 2007. These results were not uniform across groups. For example, between 2006 and 2007, real median household income rose for non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks but remained statistically unchanged for Asians and Hispanics; the poverty rate increased for children under 18 years old but remained statistically unchanged for people 18 to 64 years old and people 65 and over; and the percentage of people without health insurance decreased for the native-born population, while the foreign-born population remained statistically unchanged.2, 3 These results are discussed in more detail in the three main sections of this report income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. Each section presents estimates by characteristics such as race, Hispanic origin, nativity, and region.

A companion article (part I) addresses additional conditions. Methods The National Arthritis Data Workgroup reviewed published analyses from available national surveys, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. Because data based on national population samples are unavailable for most specific rheumatic conditions, we derived estimates from published studies of smaller, defined populations. For specific conditions, the best available prevalence estimates were applied to the corresponding 2005 US population estimates from the Census Bureau, to estimate the number affected with each condition. Results We estimated that among US adults, nearly 27 million have clinical osteoarthritis (up from the estimate of 21 million for 1995), 711,000 have polymyalgia rheumatica, 228,000 have giant cell arteritis, up to 3.0 million have had self‐reported gout in the past year (up from the estimate of 2.1 million for 1995), 5.0 million have fibromyalgia, 4–10 million have carpal tunnel syndrome, 59 million have had low back pain in the past 3 months, and 30.1 million have had neck pain in the past 3 months.

The problem addressed by the methodology is that of matching two files of individual data under conditions of uncertainty. Each field is subject to error which is measured by the probability that the field agrees given a record pair matches (called the m probability) and probabilities of chance agreement of its value states (called the u probability). Fellegi and Sunter pioneered record linkage theory. Advances in methodology include use of an EM algorithm for parameter estimation, optimization of matches by means of a linear sum assignment program, and more recently, a probability model that addresses both m and u probabilities for all value states of a field. This provides a means for obtaining greater precision from non‐uniformly distributed fields, without the theoretical complications arising from frequency‐based matching alone. The model includes an interative parameter estimation procedure that is more robust than pre‐match estimation techniques. The methodology was originally developed and tested by the author at the U.S. Census Bureau for census undercount estimation. The more recent advances and a new generalized software system were tested and validated by linking highway crashes to Emergency Medical Service (EMS) reports and to hospital admission records for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).",1995,1995-03-15,793,Matthew A.

Understanding the impact of a graying nation on cancer prevalence and comorbidity burden is critical in informing efforts to design and implement quality cancer care for this population. Methods: Incidence and survival data from 1975 to 2011 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program to estimate current cancer prevalence. SEER-Medicare claims data were used to estimate comorbidity burden. Prevalence projections were made using U.S. Census Bureau data and the Prevalence Incidence Approach Model, assuming constant future incidence and survival trends but dynamic projections of the U.S. population. Results: In 2016, there were an estimated 15.5 million cancer survivors living in the United States, 62% of whom were 65 years or older. The prevalent population is projected to grow to 26.1 million by 2040, and include 73% of survivors who are 65 years and older. Comorbidity burden was highest in the oldest survivors (those ≥85 years) and worst among lung cancer survivors. Conclusions: Older adults, who often present with complex health needs, now constitute the majority of cancer survivors and will continue to dominate the survivor population over the next 24 years. Impact: The oldest adults (i.e., those &amp;gt;75 years) should be priority populations in a pressing cancer control and prevention research agenda that includes expanding criteria for clinical trials to recruit more elderly participants and developing relevant supportive care interventions.

It reconstructs the history of racial categorization in American and Brazilian censuses from each country’s first census in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries up through the 2000 census. It sharply challenges certain presumptions that guide scholarly and popular studies, notably that census bureaus are (or are designed to be) innocent bystanders in the arena of politics, and that racial data are innocuous demographic data. Using previously overlooked historical sources, the book demonstrates that counting by race has always been a fundamentally political process, shaping in important ways the experiences and meanings of citizenship. This counting has also helped to create and to further ideas about race itself. The author argues that far from being mere producers of racial statistics, American and Brazilian censuses have been the ultimate insiders with respect to racial politics. For most of their histories, American and Brazilian censuses were tightly controlled by state officials, social scientists, and politicians. Over the past thirty years in the United States and the past twenty years in Brazil, however, certain groups within civil society have organized and lobbied to alter the methods of racial categorization. This book analyzes both the attempt of America’s multiracial movement to have a multiracial category added to the U.S. census and the attempt by Brazil’s black movement to include racial terminology in census forms. Because of these efforts, census bureau officials in the United States and Brazil today work within political and institutional constraints unknown to their predecessors. Categorization has become as much a “bottom-up” process as a “top-down” one.",2000,2000-07-01,624,Melissa Nobles,,Census and Population Estimation,Stanford University Press eBooks,07,"Nobles, Melissa. 2000.

In four experiments, we explored how salience of such racial demographic shifts affects White Americans’ political-party leanings and expressed political ideology. Study 1 revealed that making California’s majority-minority shift salient led politically unaffiliated White Americans to lean more toward the Republican Party and express greater political conservatism. Studies 2, 3a, and 3b revealed that making the changing national racial demographics salient led White Americans (regardless of political affiliation) to endorse conservative policy positions more strongly.

Adverse health impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic studies have identified specific population and community characteristics that mark vulnerability to heat waves.ObjectivesWe situated vulnerability to heat in geographic space and identified potential areas for intervention and further research.MethodsWe mapped and analyzed 10 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality in the United States: six demographic characteristics and two household air conditioning variables from the U.S. Census Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and diabetes prevalence from a national survey. We performed a factor analysis of these 10 variables and assigned values of increasing vulnerability for the four resulting factors to each of 39,794 census tracts. We added the four factor scores to obtain a cumulative heat vulnerability index value.ResultsFour factors explained > 75% of the total variance in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a) social/environmental vulnerability (combined education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation, c) air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion elderly/diabetes. We found substantial spatial variability of heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher vulnerability in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the lowest in the Southeast. In urban areas, inner cities showed the highest vulnerability to heat.ConclusionsThese methods provide a template for making local and regional heat vulnerability maps.

We assessed the community-based trends in AF incidence for 1980 to 2000 and provided prevalence projections to 2050. Methods and Results— The adult residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who had ECG-confirmed first AF in the period 1980 to 2000 (n=4618) were identified. Trends in age-adjusted incidence were determined and used to construct model-based prevalence estimates. The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of AF per 1000 person-years was 3.04 (95% CI, 2.78 to 3.31) in 1980 and 3.68 (95% CI, 3.42 to 3.95) in 2000. According to Poisson regression with adjustment for age and sex, incidence of AF increased significantly ( P =0.014), with a relative increase of 12.6% (95% CI, 2.1 to 23.1) over 21 years. The increase in age-adjusted AF incidence did not differ between men and women ( P =0.84). According to the US population projections by the US Census Bureau, the number of persons with AF is projected to be 12.1 million by 2050, assuming no further increase in age-adjusted incidence of AF, but 15.9 million if the increase in incidence continues. Conclusions— The age-adjusted incidence of AF increased significantly in Olmsted County during 1980 to 2000. Whether or not this rate of increase continues, the projected number of persons with AF for the United States will exceed 10 million by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for primary prevention strategies against AF development.",2006,2006-07-05,2496,Yoko Miyasaka; Marion E.

This work reports projections of the incidence of Alzheimer disease(AD) that will occur among older Americans in the future. Education adjusted age-specific incidence rates of clinically diagnosed probable AD were obtained from stratified random samples of residents 65 years of age and older in a geographically defined community. These rates were applied to U.S. Census Bureau projections of the total U.S. population by age and sex to estimate the number of people newly affected each year. The annual number of incident cases is expected to more than double by the midpoint of the twenty-first century: from 377,000 (95% confidence interval = 159,000–595,000) in 1995 to 959,000 (95% confidence interval = 140,000–1,778,000) in 2050. The proportion of new onset casess who are age 85 or older will increase from 40% in 1995 to 62% in 2050 when the youngest of the baby boomers will attain that age.

METHODS: We used population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2010 to 2050 and published age-specific prevalence estimates for bothersome, symptomatic pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence [UI], fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse [POP]) from the 2005 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We abstracted data regarding the number of women aged 20 years or older in 20-year age groups. We assumed that the age-specific prevalences for these disorders and the population distribution of risk factors remained unchanged thru 2050. We also conducted sensitivity analyses that varied both the prevalence estimates and the population projections. RESULTS: The number of American women with at least one pelvic floor disorder will increase from 28.1 million in 2010 to 43.8 million in 2050. During this time period, the number of women with UI will increase 55% from 18.3 million to 28.4 million. For fecal incontinence, the number of affected women will increase 59% from 10.6 to 16.8 million, and the number of women with POP will increase 46% from 3.3 to 4.9 million. The highest projections for 2050 estimate that 58.2 million women will have at least one pelvic floor disorder, with 41.3 million with UI, 25.3 million with fecal incontinence, and 9.2 million with POP. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of pelvic floor disorders will increase substantially given the changing demographics in the United States. This increase has important implications for public health and the field of gynecology.

We estimated BMI-specific lifetime diabetes risk in the U.S. for age-, sex-, and ethnicity-specific subgroups.National Health Interview Survey data (n = 780,694, 1997-2004) were used to estimate age-, race-, sex-, and BMI-specific prevalence and incidence of diabetes in 2004. U.S. Census Bureau age-, race-, and sex-specific population and mortality rate estimates for 2004 were combined with two previous studies of mortality to estimate diabetes- and BMI-specific mortality rates. These estimates were used in a Markov model to project lifetime risk of diagnosed diabetes by baseline age, race, sex, and BMI.Lifetime diabetes risk at 18 years of age increased from 7.6 to 70.3% between underweight and very obese men and from 12.2 to 74.4% for women. The lifetime risk difference was lower at older ages. At 65 years of age, compared with normal-weight male subjects, lifetime risk differences (percent) increased from 3.7 to 23.9 percentage points between overweight and very obese men and from 8.7 to 26.7 percentage points for women. The impact of BMI on diabetes duration also decreased with age.Overweight and especially obesity, particularly at younger ages, substantially increases lifetime risk of diagnosed diabetes, while their impact on diabetes risk, life expectancy, and diabetes duration diminishes with age.",2007,2007-05-25,473,K.M.

Information was collated from published literature and databases held by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (UNAIDS), the US Census Bureau, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <h3>Results</h3> There were an estimated 8.3 million (5th-95th centiles, 7.3-9.2 million) new TB cases in 2000 (137/100 000 population; range, 121/100 000-151/100 000). Tuberculosis incidence rates were highest in the WHO African Region (290/100 000 per year; range, 265/100 000-331/100 000), as was the annual rate of increase in the number of cases (6%). Nine percent (7%-12%) of all new TB cases in adults (aged 15-49 years) were attributable to HIV infection, but the proportion was much greater in the WHO African Region (31%) and some industrialized countries, notably the United States (26%). There were an estimated 1.8 million (5th-95th centiles, 1.6-2.2 million) deaths from TB, of which 12% (226 000) were attributable to HIV. Tuberculosis was the cause of 11% of all adult AIDS deaths. The prevalence of<i>M tuberculosis</i>–HIV coinfection in adults was 0.36% (11 million people). Coinfection prevalence rates equaled or exceeded 5% in 8 African countries. In South Africa alone there were 2 million coinfected adults. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The HIV pandemic presents a massive challenge to global TB control. The prevention of HIV and TB, the extension of WHO DOTS programs, and a focused effort to control HIV-related TB in areas of high HIV prevalence are matters of great urgency.",2003,2003-05-12,2607,Elizabeth L.

Information about the supplementary materials is, in most cases, critical for the reproducibility and replicability of scholarly results. In many instances, these materials are curated by a third party, which may or may not follow developing standards for the identification and description of those materials. As such, the vocabulary described here complements existing initiatives that specify vocabularies to describe the supplementary materials or the repositories and archives in which they have been deposited. Where possible, it reuses elements of relevant other vocabularies, facilitating coexistence with them. Furthermore, it provides an â€œat publicationâ€ record of reproducibility characteristics of a particular article that has been selected for publication. The proposed metadata package documents the key characteristics that journals care about in the case of supplementary materials that are held by third parties: existence, accessibility, and permanence. It does so in a robust, time-invariant fashion at the time of publication, when the editorial decisions are made. It also allows for better documentation of less accessible (non-public data), by treating it symmetrically from the point of view of the journal, therefore increasing the transparency of what up until now has been very opaque.",2021,2021-10-26,0,Lars Vilhuber; Carl Lagoze,Cornell University; University of Michigan,Library Science and Information Systems; Research Data Management Practices; Semantic Web and Ontologies,International Journal of Digital Curation,10,"Vilhuber, Lars; Lagoze, Carl. 2021.

Today, translational research in population health science offers a means of fostering their convergence, with potentially great benefit to both domains. Although evidence that the two fields need not and should not be entirely distinct in their methods and goals has been accumulating for over a decade, the prodigious efforts of biomedical and social sciences over the past year to address the COVID-19 pandemic has placed this unifying approach to translational research in both fields in a new light. Specifically, the coalescence of clinical and population-level strategies to control disease and novel uses of population-level data and tools in research relating to the pandemic have illuminated a promising future for translational research. We exploit this unique window to re-examine how translational research is conducted and where it may be going. We first discuss the transformation that has transpired in the research firmament over the past two decades and the opportunities these changes afford. Next, we present some of the challenges—technical, cultural, legal, and ethical— that need attention if these opportunities are to be successfully exploited.

The REMI PI+ model is consistent with the state of the practice in forecasting and impact analysis. REMI PI+, like its competitors, is vulnerable to the trends contained in the historical data it uses, especially recent trends. After the most recent periodic update in data, the performance of the REMI PI+ model improved, i.e., it produced long-term forecasts that were more credible. Zonal-level population and employment forecasts for direct input to the Indiana Statewide Travel Demand Model (ISTDM) can be achieved by applying disaggregation regression methods. IU’s Center for Econometric Model Research (CEMR) model is also a sound forecasting model. Because of the knowledge of in-state economists, the CEMR-IBRC model could provide forecasts of the Indiana economy that reflect characteristics not known to out-of-state forecasters. The researchers also examined economic impact analysis models that are possible alternatives to REMI PI+. Acquiring a new economic impact analysis package does not seem necessary for INDOT, if REMI forecasts can be adjusted to (a) accommodate recent and reasonable expected trends in the Indiana economy, and (b) meet the geographic (TAZ) needs of the ISTDM. MCIBAS -- which is currently used by INDOT -- is a good hybrid system to use in the economic impacts analysis of transportation projects. IU’s CEMR is capable of conducting economic impact analyses, with local knowledge of the Indiana economy, at a cost lower than REMI’s. However, INDOT would have to decide whether these potential advantages justify changing the present relationship with REMI. In cases where the credibility of data, forecasts, and/or impact analyses needs to be verified, an INDOT version of an expert panel along the lines of Michigan’s Transportation Technical Committee could be convened.",2012,2012-12-04,4,Yingge Xiong; Jon D.

Using 3SLS-IV estimation we find that the size of federal, state and local government all either negatively correlate with or are uncorrelated with economic growth. We find no evidence that government is more efficient at more or less decentralized levels. Furthermore, while we cannot separate out the productive and redistributive services of government, we document that the county-level income distribution became slightly wider from 1970 to 1998. Our findings suggest that a release of government-employed labor inputs to the private sector would be growth-enhancing.",2006,2006-01-01,4,Matthew J. Higgins; Andrew T.

A number of patterns emerge from the data. Most foreign direct investment (FDI) occurs between rich countries. The share of vertical FDI (subsidiaries which provide inputs to their parent firms) is larger than commonly thought, even within developed countries. More than half of all vertical subsidiaries are only observable at the four-digit level because the inputs they are supplying are so proximate to their parent firms' final good that they appear identical at the two-digit level. We call these proximate subsidiaries 'intra-industry' vertical FDI and find that their location and activity are significantly different to the inter-industry vertical FDI visible at the two-digit level. These subsidiaries are not readily explained by the comparative advantage considerations in traditional models, where firms locate their low skill production stages abroad in low skill countries to take advantage of factor cost differences. We find that overwhelmingly, multinationals tend to own the stages of production proximate to their final production giving rise to a class of high-skill intra-industry vertical FDI.",2007,2007-01-01,29,Laura Alfaro; Andrew Charlton,Harvard University Press; London School of Economics and Political Science,Global trade and economics; International Business and FDI; Economic Policies and Impacts,SSRN Electronic Journal,01,"Alfaro, Laura; Charlton, Andrew. 2007.

The US Census Bureau makes available restricted data that may be used for measuring fertility, but the data have not previously been described for a scholarly audience or used for fertility research.This paper describes and analyzes restricted-use administrative birth data available through the Census Numident for nearly all US births for more than the last century. Within these data, most births since 1997 are linked to parents through the Census Household Composition Key (CHCK). These analyses are designed to illustrate the scope and limitations of these data for the study of US fertility.We describe the creation and content of the Census Numindent and CHCK data sets and compare the data to published US vital statistics. We also analyze the geographic coverage of both data sets and compare the demographic composition of the new data sources to national demographic composition. We further illustrate how these novel data sources may be used by comparing them to survey responses at the individual level.This paper describes an underutilized source of national US data for studying fertility, shows the quality of these data by performing analyses, and explains how scholars can access these data for research.",2022,2022-07-07,6,Katie R.

An emerging literature suggests biomarkers of inflammation vary by geography of residence at the state-level, and are associated with individual-level socioeconomic status. Associations between cardiovascular inflammation and state-level socioeconomic conditions have not been evaluated. The study objective is to estimate whether there are independent associations between state-level socioeconomic conditions and individual-level biomarkers of inflammation, in excess of individual-level income and clinical covariates among healthy women. Methods The authors examined cross-sectional multilevel associations among state-level socioeconomic conditions, individual-level income, and biomarkers of inflammation among women (n = 26,029) in the Women's Health Study, a nation-wide cohort of healthy women free of cardiovascular diseases at enrollment. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and fibrinogen were measured between 1993 and 1996. Biomarker levels were examined among women within quartiles of state-level socioeconomic conditions and within categories of individual-level income. Results The authors found that favorable state-level socioeconomic conditions were correlated with lower hsCRP, in excess of individual-level income (e.g. state-level real per capital gross domestic product fixed effect standardized Βeta coefficient [Std B] -0.03, 95% CI -0.05, -0.004). Individual-level income was more closely associated with sICAM-1 (Std B -0.04, 95% CI -0.06, -0.03) and fibrinogen (Std B -0.05, 95% CI -0.06, -0.03) than state-level conditions. Conclusions We found associations between state-level socioeconomic conditions and hsCRP among healthy women. Personal household income was more closely associated with sICAM-1 and fibrinogen than state-level socioeconomic conditions. Additional research should examine these associations in other cohorts, and investigate what more-advantaged states do differently than less-advantaged states that may influence levels of cardiovascular inflammation among healthy women.",2012,2012-03-20,15,Cheryl R.
